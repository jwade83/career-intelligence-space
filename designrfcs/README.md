# Design RFCs

This directory contains Request for Comments (RFC) documents for significant design decisions and architectural changes within the Career Intelligence Space platform.

## Purpose

RFCs serve as a formal process for proposing, discussing, and documenting major design decisions. They ensure that:

- Design decisions are well-documented and rationale is preserved
- Stakeholders can review and provide feedback on proposed changes
- Implementation paths are clearly defined
- Alternative approaches are considered
- Risks and trade-offs are identified

## Relationship to Design Lane

RFCs work in conjunction with the Design Lane process documented in `/docs/design/`:

- **Design Lane**: Provides the framework, templates, and methodology for design work
- **RFCs**: Document specific design proposals and decisions using that framework
- **Architecture**: RFCs often result in architectural changes that are reflected in system documentation

The Design Lane serves as the "how" for design work, while RFCs serve as the "what" for specific proposals.

## RFC Process

1. **Draft**: Create a new RFC using `RFCTEMPLATE.md`
2. **Review**: Circulate for feedback and discussion
3. **Revision**: Update based on feedback
4. **Decision**: Accept, reject, or request further changes
5. **Implementation**: If accepted, track implementation progress
6. **Archive**: Mark as completed or superseded

## File Naming Convention

- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`
- Example: `2025-09-19-sample-rfc.md`

## Templates

- `RFCTEMPLATE.md`: Standard template for new RFCs
- `2025-09-19-sample-rfc.md`: Example RFC showing proper structure
