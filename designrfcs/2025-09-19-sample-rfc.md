# RFC: Career Compass Integration Enhancement

**Date**: 2025-09-19  
**Author**: System Designer  
**Status**: Draft  
**Related**: [Design Lane career-compass.md](../docs/design/2025-09-19-career-compass.md)  

## Context

**Background and Problem Statement**

This sample RFC demonstrates the RFC process and structure for the Career Intelligence Space platform. It references the career-compass.md design note to show how RFCs build upon Design Lane artifacts.

The career compass design establishes foundational patterns for navigation and discovery within the career intelligence platform. This RFC proposes specific enhancements to integrate the compass more deeply with user workflows.

**Scope and Objectives**

- Demonstrate RFC structure and process
- Show relationship between Design Lane and RFC processes
- Provide template example for future RFCs
- Reference existing design artifacts appropriately

## Proposal

**Overview**

Enhance the career compass integration by implementing deeper workflow connections and improved user experience patterns as outlined in the Design Lane documentation.

**Detailed Design**

[This section would contain specific implementation details in a real RFC, building upon the foundational design work documented in career-compass.md]

**Examples and Use Cases**

[Concrete examples would be provided here showing how the enhanced integration works in practice]

## Rationale

**Why This Approach**

This sample demonstrates how RFCs extend and formalize the design concepts established in the Design Lane process, particularly the career compass navigation patterns.

**Benefits and Expected Outcomes**

- Demonstrates proper RFC structure
- Shows Design Lane integration
- Provides reusable template

**Trade-offs and Limitations**

As a sample RFC, this document prioritizes demonstration over comprehensive technical detail.

## Alternatives

**Alternative 1: Standalone RFC Process**

RFCs could operate independently without Design Lane integration, but this would lose valuable design context and continuity.

**Status Quo**

Without a formal RFC process, design decisions might lack proper documentation and review.

## Risks

**Technical Risks**

Minimal technical risk as this is a demonstration document.

**Mitigation Strategies**

Ensure real RFCs contain appropriate technical depth and analysis.

## Promotion Path

**Implementation Plan**

1. Finalize RFC template and process
2. Create example RFCs for reference
3. Train team on RFC usage
4. Integrate with Design Lane workflow

**Timeline and Milestones**

- RFC process establishment: Complete
- Team training: TBD
- First production RFC: TBD

## Provenance
