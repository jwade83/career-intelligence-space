# MP → CI Intake Inventory (2025-09-16)

**Purpose:** Read-only discovery of deliverables to stage into Career Intelligence (CI) without modifying the Master Portfolio & Career Framework (MP/CF).  
**Guardrails:** Read-only from MP/CF, prefer `.md`/`.csv` in CI, redact PII, flag NDA-sensitive items.
