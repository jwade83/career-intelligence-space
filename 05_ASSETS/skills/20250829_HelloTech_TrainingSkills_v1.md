## Skills by Category (ATS)
### Networking & Connectivity
- Diagnose WAN/LAN issues; perform **Wi‑Fi surveys** and **speed tests**; extend coverage (APs/extenders) while respecting existing configs.
- Configure routers/APs; verify **DHCP/DNS**; document SSID/security settings; validate throughput and roaming.
- Implement **multicast paging** integrations (e.g., Snom/Algo) and verify audio clarity end‑to‑end.
- Integrate business devices (e.g., **Square POS**) with secure Wi‑Fi/Ethernet and perform transactional test flows.

### Smart Home & IoT
- Install and configure **video doorbells & cameras** (Ring, Logitech Circle, Ecobee): mounting, **transformer/chime** checks, app setup, motion zones, notifications.
- Deploy **smart locks** (Amazon Key, Level): door inspection, hardware install, handing process, app pairing, access control training.
- Install **smart thermostats** (Nest/Ecobee/Honeywell): **compatibility/wiring** checks, safe power‑off, labeling, app linkage, HVAC test.
- Platform setup (**SmartThings**, Insteon/partner kits): hub install, **ZigBee/Z‑Wave** pairing, sensor placement, scenes/automations, Smart Home Monitor.
- General IoT troubleshooting: pairing flows, firmware updates, network dependencies, privacy/safety best practices.

### A/V & Entertainment Systems
- **TV mounting** to code/safety standards: stud finding, leveling, load rating, **cord concealment**, and post‑install checks.
- Smart TV onboarding (Samsung): network/app sign‑ins, OneRemote configuration, basic **calibration** (picture/sound).
- Integrate audio (soundbars, speakers) and manage **HDMI/ARC** setups.

### PC & Mobile Device Onboarding
- **Android/iOS** setup: account sign‑in, security (Face/Touch ID), backups, app installs, cross‑device sync.
- **Samsung S8/S9**: beginner/intermediate/advanced flows (Bixby, camera, performance optimization, safe mode, cache clear).
- Customer education: settings, app store usage, data hygiene, and support resources.

### Business VoIP & Telephony (Ooma Office)
- Provision base and **IP phones**; configure **extensions/voicemail/virtual receptionist**; assist number porting.
- Deploy **multi‑site** and **overhead paging** integrations; validate call routing, paging reach, and QoS.
- Support **Yealink WF50** Wi‑Fi dongle setups; recommend Ethernet for rapid config downloads when feasible.

### Customer‑Facing & Compliance
- Pre‑appointment checklist (accounts, Wi‑Fi readiness, hardware on site); safety protocols for electrical and ladder work.
- App training and **live demo** of critical features; **service notes** with device inventory and settings.
- Compliance/ID capture (e.g., **Reverie** serial/product codes); warranty and support handoffs.

## Diagnostic Workflow Patterns
**1) Triage → 2) Verify Power/Network → 3) Device Pairing/Provisioning → 4) Feature Validation → 5) Customer Training → 6) Documentation/Escalation**
- Triage: reproduce symptoms; record environment; check vendor status pages.
- Power/Network: confirm power/transformer output, link quality, SSID/security, DHCP lease, internet reachability.
- Pair/Provision: follow vendor pairing flows; confirm firmware; bind to accounts; validate status LEDs/app indicators.
- Validate: functional tests (stream, call, motion detect, lock/unlock, heat/cool cycle); cross‑device checks.
- Train: demonstrate core workflows; confirm customer proficiency; provide quick‑start resources.
- Document: service notes (devices, settings, serials); escalation paths when hardware/ISP dependencies block success.
