# Bridge Addendum — Non-Negotiable Antibodies

**Reframe "gaps" → antibodies.** Failure to implement any core antibody guarantees
cascade collapse: Ontology+linter (keystone), Decision Log (provenance),
Charter (constraints), Checkpoints (recovery), Context Packs (entropy control),
Cascade Sensors & Stress (antifragility). Blocking enforcement, not advisory.

## 1. Cascade Dynamics as Existential Threat
- **Cursor framing:** examples of cascades, severity scoring, recovery playbooks.
- **Harness doctrine:** cascades are the default mode of collapse.
- **Non-negotiable:** Early warning detectors must be implemented, not just documented.
- **Requirement:** Define cascade sensors for each C1–C7 pair and enforce in CI.
- **Without this:** collapse will not be incremental; it will be compound and unrecoverable.

## 2. Externalization as Operating Doctrine
- **Cursor framing:** helpful enforcement mechanisms (pre-commit hooks, audits).
- **Harness doctrine:** "Nothing lives only in chat" is a constitutional law.
- **Non-negotiable:** Every decision, conversation, and prompt output must produce an artifact.
- **Requirement:** Automated audit reports must flag and block non-externalized threads.
- **Without this:** evidence entropy (C6) and thread fragmentation (C7) resurface immediately.

## 3. Ontology + Linter as Keystone Antibody
- **Cursor framing:** Ontology is desirable for blocking vocabulary drift.
- **Harness doctrine:** Ontology is the keystone; without it, every other antibody erodes.
- **Non-negotiable:** ontology.yml must exist and be enforced by a blocking linter.
- **Requirement:** CI pipeline halts on synonym drift; no exceptions.
- **Without this:** vocabulary drift (C3) cascades into instruction dilution (C2) and ambiguity (C4).

## 4. Provenance as Existential Requirement
- **Cursor framing:** structured decision log with reversibility and reconstruction tests is "needed."
- **Harness doctrine:** provenance is existential.
- **Non-negotiable:** No decision exists until logged with rationale, reversibility, and criteria.
- **Requirement:** Reconstruction tests must be runnable in CI.
- **Without this:** decision context dissolves → evidence entropy (C6).

## 5. Checkpoints vs. Commits
- **Cursor framing:** checkpoints as a stronger form of git commit.
- **Harness doctrine:** checkpoints are recovery anchors, not optional extras.
- **Non-negotiable:** Every milestone must produce a tagged checkpoint with recovery metadata.
- **Requirement:** Rollback procedures documented and testable.
- **Without this:** rollback becomes impossible; context loss is permanent.

## 6. Charter as Constraint Ledger
- **Cursor framing:** Charter as evolving ruleset for guidance.
- **Harness doctrine:** Charter defines the immune system itself.
- **Non-negotiable:** Non-negotiable constraints must be enumerated and enforced.
- **Requirement:** Violations trigger blocks, not warnings.
- **Without this:** goal creep (C5) silently erodes every other antibody.

## 7. Antifragility Through Deliberate Stressors
- **Cursor framing:** track stressors, measure recovery.
- **Harness doctrine:** antifragility must be deliberately induced.
- **Non-negotiable:** System must schedule controlled failures to test immune response.
- **Requirement:** Stress-test metrics must be tracked and reported.
- **Without this:** the system only adapts reactively, never hardens proactively.

**Key Insight:**

Cursor's framing is a valuable systems-engineering lens. But Harness doctrine requires sharper language: these are not optional "gaps" but non-negotiable antibodies.

Failure to implement any one of them guarantees collapse — not gradually, but through cascading failure across C1–C7.

---

**Action Path:**
1. Reclassify "gaps" → antibodies.
2. Elevate enforcement to blocking.
3. Implement cascade sensors.
4. Test antifragility through deliberate stressors.

Harness is not additive scaffolding — it is an immune system. Every antibody is required.
