# Final Release Addendum ‚Äî Harness-Doctrine Status Adjustment

**Date:** 2025-10-01  
**Scope:** Corrective adjustment to Harness-Doctrine status table from Final Release summary.  
**Purpose:** Ensure accuracy between Harness doctrine and implementation reality.

---

## üéØ Context

The Final Release (2025-09-30) correctly documented closure of all major operational gaps and footguns.

However, the Harness-Doctrine table overstated full coverage across C1‚ÄìC7 collapse risks. This addendum refines the assessment to preserve doctrinal accuracy and prevent drift.

---

## üìä Adjusted Harness-Doctrine Status Table

| Collapse Risk | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|---------------|--------|----------------|-------|
| **C1. Context Saturation** | ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING | Modular docs exist, but no automated context pack generator | Deferred to future phase (Context Packs). |
| **C2. Instruction Dilution** | ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING | Role definitions exist in doctrine, but no scoped prompt enforcement | Dependent on C1 context packs. |
| **C3. Vocabulary Drift** | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | Ontology file exists and is CODEOWNED, schema validated | No synonym-drift linter yet; enforcement incomplete. |
| **C4. Reference Ambiguity** | ‚úÖ COMPLETE | Link/anchor checker, stable IDs, `related:` validation | Coverage achieved with lychee workflow. |
| **C5. Goal Creep** | ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING | Informal scope boundaries in place | No Charter.yml constraints with CI enforcement yet. |
| **C6. Evidence Entropy** | ‚úÖ COMPLETE | Decision Log structure, checkpoint tags, provenance chain | Provenance chain preserved. |
| **C7. Thread Fragmentation** | ‚úÖ COMPLETE | Chronicle integration, silo externalization, PR template enforcement | Continuity preserved. |
| **Antifragility** | ‚úÖ COMPLETE | Monthly canary stress test (C6 focus) | Expand test battery over time (C3, C4, C5 cascades). |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Clarification

- **Closed Risks (C4, C6, C7, Antifragility)** are robust and production-hardened.
- **Pending Risks (C1, C2, C5)** require explicit system components (context packs, Charter.yml) before doctrine is satisfied.
- **Partial (C3)** is covered structurally but requires a vocabulary linter to block synonym drift.

---

## üöÄ Next Actions (Future Silo Candidates)

### 1. Context Packs (C1/C2)
- Build `scripts/context-pack-generator.py`
- Enforce scoped prompts with token limits.

### 2. Ontology Linter (C3)
- Implement vocabulary drift detection against `docs/ONTOLOGY.yml`
- CI block for non-canonical synonyms.

### 3. Charter Enforcement (C5)
- Draft `docs/CHARTER.yml` with non-negotiable constraints.
- Add CI validation and violation detection.

### 4. Stress Test Expansion (Antifragility)
- Add quarterly canaries for:
  - C3 (synonym drift injection)
  - C4 (reference ambiguity)
  - C5 (goal creep simulation)

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This adjustment ensures the Harness-Doctrine map reflects truth in implementation:

- **Strong, production-ready immune system core** (C3 partial, C4, C6, C7, antifragility).
- **Deferred but non-negotiable antibodies** (C1, C2, C5) explicitly tracked for future activation.

By documenting these caveats, we prevent doctrinal overstatement and preserve antifragility.
