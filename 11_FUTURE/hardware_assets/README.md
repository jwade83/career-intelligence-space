# Hardware / Asset Roadmap (Silo)

**Purpose:** Preserve the full reasoning and implementation plan for hardware/hosted assets
that strengthen Harness immunity (C1–C7) without cluttering the active repo. This is
_deferred but preserved_ work with explicit review triggers.

## Contents
- **Roadmap** → `20250930_Hardware_Asset_Roadmap.md` (MVI tiers, costs, SLOs, acceptance gates)
- **Bridge Note** → `BRIDGE_NOTE.md` (why Harness ≠ checklist; immune-system framing)
- **Addendums**
  - `ADDENDUMS/20250930_Bridge_Addendum_Nonnegotiable_Antibodies.md`
  - `ADDENDUMS/20250930_Phased_Antibody_Deployment.md`
- **TODOs / Triggers** → `TODOs.md` (when to promote from FUTURE → docs/)

## Promotion Path (when activated)
When a trigger in `TODOs.md` is met:
1. Create a Decision Log entry referencing this silo.
2. Move/duplicate Roadmap and Addendums under `docs/architecture/harness/hardware/`.
3. Tag a **checkpoint** and run rollback dry-run.
4. Announce in Chronicle with links to Decision and checkpoint tag.

> Status: **deferred**. See review on `review_date`.
