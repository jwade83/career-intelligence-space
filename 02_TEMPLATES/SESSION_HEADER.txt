SESSION HEADER â€” paste at start of any assistant session

As of 2025-09-26, follow these rules:

- Required checks on main: contexts `links` and `gate`, strict true, admins enforced.
- Only PR-event runs count toward protection (pull_request or push to PR branch); `workflow_dispatch` does not.
- Every changed .md must begin with front-matter: project, type, status, tags, updated.
  - type in {capsule, memo, assessment, log, decision, spec}
  - status in {draft, matured, archived}
- In docs/, use relative links like ](./file.md), never ](docs/...).
- Merge path: enable auto-merge, then run pr_health: `python3 .github/scripts/pr_health.py <PR#>`.
