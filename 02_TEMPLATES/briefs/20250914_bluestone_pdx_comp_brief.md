**Research Source:** [03_RESEARCH/companies/bluestone/20250914_int2_comp_scope.md](../../03_RESEARCH/companies/bluestone/20250914_int2_comp_scope.md)
  
**Position:** Building Maintenance Technician - Bluestone Property Management
  
**Market:** Portland, Oregon
  
**Date:** September 15, 2025

## Market Parity Assessment

Portland building maintenance technician positions currently range from $18.50-$35.00/hour depending on experience, with market averages 15-20% above national median. Entry-level positions (0-2 years) typically command $18.50-$22.00/hour ($38,480-$45,760 annually), while experienced technicians (8+ years) earn $28.50-$35.00/hour ($59,280-$72,800 annually).

Bluestone's compensation appears positioned below market median, particularly concerning given their "no overtime" policyâ€”unusual for BMT roles where on-call and emergency work typically provide significant earning opportunities. Property management companies generally pay lower range versus commercial facilities, but competitive positions include union premiums ($3-5/hour) and certification bonuses (10-15% increase). 

Market research indicates limited advancement pathways and operational stability concerns may further impact total compensation value relative to Portland area opportunities.
