# Meta-Cognitive Review Prompts Template

## Purpose

This template provides structured prompts for meta-cognitive review to prevent phase mismatches and promote self-awareness during documentation and thinking processes.

## Phase-Specific Review Prompts

### **Sandboxing Phase (Divergent Thinking)**

**Before finalizing any sandboxing document, ask yourself:**

#### **Phase Alignment**
- [ ] Am I preserving ambiguity and multiple possibilities?
- [ ] Am I capturing the exploration process, not just outcomes?
- [ ] Am I using divergent thinking tools (exploration_log, hypothesis_tracking, process_capture)?
- [ ] Am I avoiding premature convergence or summarization?

#### **Process Preservation**
- [ ] Am I documenting the "why now" context that triggered this exploration?
- [ ] Am I capturing fragile insights that could be lost?
- [ ] Am I preserving the emotional and energetic context?
- [ ] Am I maintaining the exploration journey, not just conclusions?

#### **Meta-Cognitive Awareness**
- [ ] Am I aware of my own thinking mode during this work?
- [ ] Am I applying the right type of thinking for this phase?
- [ ] Am I recognizing when I'm defaulting to convergent thinking during exploration?

### **Design Phase (Convergent Thinking)**

**Before finalizing any design document, ask yourself:**

#### **Phase Alignment**
- [ ] Am I making clear decisions and choices?
- [ ] Am I using convergent thinking tools (capsule, decision, spec, assessment)?
- [ ] Am I synthesizing rather than exploring?
- [ ] Am I creating structure and clarity?

#### **Decision Documentation**
- [ ] Am I clearly articulating the reasoning behind decisions?
- [ ] Am I documenting what was considered and why it was rejected?
- [ ] Am I providing clear implementation guidance?
- [ ] Am I capturing the decision context and constraints?

#### **Meta-Cognitive Awareness**
- [ ] Am I aware that I'm in design phase and should be converging?
- [ ] Am I avoiding exploration mode when I should be deciding?
- [ ] Am I recognizing when I'm being too exploratory during design?

### **Implementation Phase (Execution Thinking)**

**Before finalizing any implementation document, ask yourself:**

#### **Phase Alignment**
- [ ] Am I focused on execution and operation?
- [ ] Am I monitoring and maintaining rather than exploring?
- [ ] Am I using implementation-focused tools (log, memo, assessment)?
- [ ] Am I providing actionable guidance for execution?

#### **Execution Documentation**
- [ ] Am I documenting specific steps and procedures?
- [ ] Am I capturing operational context and constraints?
- [ ] Am I providing monitoring and maintenance guidance?
- [ ] Am I documenting lessons learned and improvements?

#### **Meta-Cognitive Awareness**
- [ ] Am I aware that I'm in implementation phase and should be executing?
- [ ] Am I avoiding design exploration when I should be implementing?
- [ ] Am I recognizing when I'm being too theoretical during implementation?

## Universal Meta-Cognitive Prompts

### **Self-Awareness Questions**
- [ ] What thinking mode am I currently using?
- [ ] Is this thinking mode appropriate for my current phase?
- [ ] Am I experiencing any cognitive dissonance or phase mismatch?
- [ ] What would happen if I used a different thinking mode?

### **Process Review Questions**
- [ ] Am I capturing process, not just outcomes?
- [ ] Am I preserving context that future me will need?
- [ ] Am I documenting the "why" behind my approach?
- [ ] Am I maintaining the thinking journey, not just conclusions?

### **Phase Transition Questions**
- [ ] Am I ready to move to the next phase?
- [ ] What evidence do I have that this phase is complete?
- [ ] What would I lose by moving to the next phase too early?
- [ ] What would I gain by staying in this phase longer?

## Collapse Prevention Prompts

### **Context Preservation**
- [ ] Have I captured the "why now" context?
- [ ] Have I documented what triggered this work?
- [ ] Have I preserved emotional and energetic context?
- [ ] Have I maintained fragile insights that could be lost?

### **System Integrity**
- [ ] Am I maintaining the philosophical approach to information formation?
- [ ] Am I preserving the "in-formation" process, not just outcomes?
- [ ] Am I avoiding premature summarization that kills meta-insight?
- [ ] Am I maintaining the active frame rather than creating dead artifacts?

### **Meta-Insight Generation**
- [ ] Am I generating insights about my own thinking process?
- [ ] Am I recognizing patterns in my own work?
- [ ] Am I learning from my own meta-cognitive awareness?
- [ ] Am I building recursive improvement into my process?

## Template Usage

### **For Individual Documents**
1. Copy the appropriate phase-specific prompts
2. Answer each question honestly
3. Revise your document based on your answers
4. Document any meta-insights you gained

### **For Phase Transitions**
1. Use the phase transition questions
2. Gather evidence for phase completion
3. Document the transition rationale
4. Set up appropriate prompts for the new phase

### **For Regular Reviews**
1. Use universal meta-cognitive prompts
2. Assess your overall thinking mode alignment
3. Identify patterns in your work
4. Adjust your approach based on insights

## Integration with Workflows

### **Pre-Commit Hooks**
- Run phase-specific prompts before committing
- Ensure phase-appropriate tool selection
- Validate context preservation

### **Daily Reviews**
- Use universal prompts for self-assessment
- Check for phase mismatches
- Generate meta-insights about your process

### **Phase Transitions**
- Use transition prompts to validate readiness
- Document transition rationale
- Set up appropriate prompts for new phase
