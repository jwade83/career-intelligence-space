Dear [Hiring Manager’s Name],

I am writing to express my interest in the [Job Title] position at [Company Name], as advertised on [Job Board/Company Site]. With over a decade of hands-on experience in IT support, smart home integration, and customer-facing technical services, I bring both technical depth and practical problem-solving to environments that demand precision, reliability, and adaptability.

In my current work as a Field Technician with HelloTech, I completed training and certification across 50+ technical modules spanning networking, smart devices, VoIP, and A/V systems. This experience allowed me to:
- Configure and troubleshoot residential and small-business networks (routers, modems, Wi-Fi optimization).
- Deploy and integrate IoT ecosystems (SmartThings, Alexa, Google Home, Level smart locks, thermostats).
- Install and support Ooma Office VoIP solutions for multi-site clients.
- Deliver structured diagnostic workflows, reducing repeat service calls by 25%.

In addition, my independent contracts background in property technology and turnover QA reinforced my ability to coordinate with vendors, assess technical risks, and communicate directly with clients in high-stakes environments. This blend of IT proficiency and customer service equips me to contribute immediately to your team.

I am particularly drawn to [Company Name]’s mission/project focus], and I see a strong alignment between my technical training and your team’s goals. I am eager to contribute my skills while continuing to develop in areas such as advanced network administration and IT service management.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in IT support and smart technology integration can bring value to your organization. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to [Company Name]’s success.

Sincerely,
John Wade
