  - [Research Intake](../../tasks/queue/20250917-research-lead1.yml)  
  - [Synth Intake](../../tasks/queue/20250917-synth-lead1.yml)  
  - [Intel Intake](../../tasks/queue/20250917-intel-lead1.yml)  
- Deliverables committed:  
  - [Comp Scope](../../03_RESEARCH/leads/smartbuild_senior_bmt_comp_scope.md)  
  - [Comp Table](../../02_TEMPLATES/comp/20250917_smartbuild_senior_bmt_comp_table.md)  
  - [Comp Brief](../../02_TEMPLATES/briefs/20250917_smartbuild_senior_bmt_comp_brief.md)  
  - [Intel Deliverable](../../03_RESEARCH/findings/20250917_smartbuild_senior_bmt_intel.md)

## Promotion Candidates
