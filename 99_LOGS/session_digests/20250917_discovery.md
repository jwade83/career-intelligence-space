# Discovery Agent Session Digest - 2025-09-17

## Session Overview

**Session Date:** 2025-09-17  
**Session Type:** Discovery Agent Test Run  
**Status:** Completed Successfully  
**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Scope:** Portland/Seattle/Remote - Maintenance Technician, Smart Home, Skilled Trades  

## Objectives & Results

### Primary Objectives
- [x] Execute first Discovery Agent test run using new schema framework
- [x] Test automated opportunity discovery workflow
- [x] Generate structured opportunity data exports
- [x] Validate CI/CD pipeline integration

### Key Results
- **Discovery Agent Schema:** Successfully implemented in `agents/discovery.yml`
- **Orchestrator Integration:** Queue intake created and processed
- **Data Export:** Structured CSV and markdown outputs generated
- **CI Validation:** All validation checks passed

## Session Metrics

### Performance Indicators
- **Runtime:** ~6 seconds (CI validation job)
- **Opportunities Discovered:** [Data files generated]
- **Geographic Coverage:** Portland, Seattle, Remote positions
- **Search Keywords:** Maintenance technician, smart home, skilled trades
- **Success Rate:** 100% (all validation checks passed)

### Resource Utilization
- **Repository Files Created:** 3 (agent schema, queue intake, opportunity data)
- **CI Jobs Triggered:** 2 (validation pipeline runs)
- **Storage Impact:** Minimal (structured data files)

## Technical Implementation

### Agent Schema Development
- **File:** [`agents/discovery.yml`](../../agents/discovery.yml)
- **Standards:** Matched CI and orchestration requirements
- **Extensibility:** Version-controlled for future enhancement

### Orchestration Workflow
- **Queue File:** [`tasks/queue/20250917-orch-discovery-test.yml`](../../tasks/queue/20250917-orch-discovery-test.yml)
- **Processing:** Automated intake and execution
- **Status:** Successfully completed

### Data Outputs
- **Research Data:** [`03_RESEARCH/`](../../03_RESEARCH/) - Opportunity CSV export
- **Format:** Structured data with metadata
- **Accessibility:** Machine and human readable

## Process Workflow

1. **Schema Creation** → Agent definition established
2. **Queue Setup** → Orchestrator intake prepared
3. **CI Validation** → Automated checks executed
4. **Agent Execution** → Discovery workflow triggered
5. **Data Export** → Results captured and structured
6. **Verification** → Output validation completed

## Limitations & Constraints

### Current Limitations
- **Geographic Scope:** Limited to Portland/Seattle/Remote for testing
- **Keywords:** Focused on maintenance/smart home/skilled trades
- **Data Volume:** Initial test run with controlled scope
- **Integration:** Early-stage workflow validation

### Resource Constraints
- **Processing Time:** Minimal for test scope
- **Storage Requirements:** Low impact on repository size
- **CI Resources:** Standard validation pipeline usage

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Checks
- [x] Agent schema validates against CI requirements
- [x] Queue file passes orchestration standards
- [x] Data exports conform to expected formats
- [x] All CI headings and structures maintained

### Error Handling
- **Issues Encountered:** Initial CI validation flagged missing headings
- **Resolution:** Required sections added to pass compliance
- **Prevention:** Template structure now established for future runs

## Lessons Learned

### Success Factors
- **Schema-First Approach:** Well-defined agent structure enabled smooth execution
- **CI Integration:** Automated validation caught compliance issues early
- **Structured Output:** Consistent data formats support analysis

### Areas for Improvement
- **Documentation:** Session digest templates needed for consistency
- **Automation:** Additional workflow steps could be automated
- **Monitoring:** Real-time progress tracking would be valuable

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Review generated opportunity data for quality
- [ ] Analyze geographic coverage patterns
- [ ] Assess keyword effectiveness

### Medium-term Enhancements
- [ ] Expand geographic scope for broader testing
- [ ] Add additional industry keywords
- [ ] Implement automated quality scoring
- [ ] Develop performance benchmarks

### Long-term Strategy
- [ ] Scale to production opportunity discovery
- [ ] Integrate with application tracking systems
- [ ] Implement machine learning optimization
- [ ] Build comprehensive monitoring dashboard
