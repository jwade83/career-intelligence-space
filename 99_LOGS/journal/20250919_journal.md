# Captain's Log - September 19, 2025

**Date:** 2025-09-19
**Author:** Comet Assistant
**Session Context:** Design Lane Implementation and Documentation Enhancement

## Daily Journal

Today's session focused on implementing the Design Lane scaffold for the Career Intelligence Space platform. This involved creating a comprehensive documentation structure for design decisions, architectural notes, and their promotion pipeline. The implementation establishes a foundation for design provenance and quality control within the repository structure.

## Notes

### Design Lane Infrastructure

• ✅ Created `/docs/design/` directory structure
• ✅ Implemented Design Lane documentation (README.md)
• ✅ Added DESIGNNOTE_TEMPLATE.md for consistent design note formatting
• ✅ Created example design note (2025-09-19-career-compass.md) demonstrating proper usage
• ✅ All files properly terminated with `# UPGRADE` footer compliance

### RFC Infrastructure

• ✅ Created `/designrfcs/` directory structure
• ✅ Implemented RFC documentation (README.md)
• ✅ Added RFCTEMPLATE.md for consistent RFC formatting
• ✅ Created sample RFC (2025-09-19-sample-rfc.md) demonstrating proper usage
• ✅ All files properly terminated with `# UPGRADE` footer compliance

### Documentation Quality

• Established clear purpose, rules, and promotion path documentation
• Implemented CI-compliant structure with provenance requirements
• Created comprehensive template covering all design decision aspects
• Demonstrated proper naming convention (YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md)

## Links

• [Design Lane README](/docs/design/README.md)
• [Design Note Template](/docs/design/DESIGNNOTE_TEMPLATE.md)
• [Career Compass Example](/docs/design/2025-09-19-career-compass.md)
• [RFC README](/designrfcs/README.md)
• [RFC Template](/designrfcs/RFCTEMPLATE.md)
• [Sample RFC](/designrfcs/2025-09-19-sample-rfc.md)

## Actions

### Primary Actions

• **Design Lane scaffold created at /docs/design/ (README, template, example). CI-compliant, provenance enforced.**
• **RFC scaffold created at /designrfcs/ (README, template, sample RFC). CI-compliant and provenance enforced.**
• Established design decision documentation workflow
• Implemented review and promotion pipeline structure
• Created integration points with 05_EXPORTS/published/ and 99_LOGS/journal
• BACnet intel report created and committed as /intel/2025-09-19-bacnet-intel.md. Provenance linked to Embark assignment.
• Upgraded BACnet intel deliverable with live provider/job market findings. File overwritten: /intel/2025-09-19-bacnet-intel.md. Provenance linked and audit chain maintained.
• Review of BACnet intel completed. File created: /docs/review/2025-09-19-bacnet-intel-review.md. Decision: Approve.
• Intel Index added/automated. /intel/INDEX.md now lists all intel reports via YAML front-matter parser. CI workflow builds on push. Provenance: scripts/index/build_intel_index.py.

### Supporting Actions

• Repository navigation and structure analysis completed
• File creation and commit process optimized
• Documentation standards alignment verified
• Template validation and example demonstration completed
• Added Design Lane cross-links in ARCHITECTURE and migration_map; auto-index live.

## Technical Details

### Files Created

1. docs/design/README.md - Design Lane framework documentation
2. docs/design/DESIGNNOTE_TEMPLATE.md - Standardized template for design notes
3. docs/design/2025-09-19-career-compass.md - Placeholder example design note
4. designrfcs/README.md - RFC framework documentation
5. designrfcs/RFCTEMPLATE.md - Standardized template for RFCs
6. designrfcs/2025-09-19-sample-rfc.md - Sample RFC demonstrating structure
7. 99_LOGS/journal/20250919_journal.md - This Captain's Log entry
8. docs/review/2025-09-19-bacnet-intel-review.md - BACnet intelligence review

### Git Operations

• Multiple commits with semantic commit messages
• Proper branch management (main branch)
• Clean commit history maintained

## Integration Points

### Established Connections

• CI/CD Integration: Automated validation framework ready
• Export Pipeline: Connection to 05_EXPORTS/published/design/
• Journal Tracking: Activity logging to 99_LOGS/journal
• Research Integration: Links to 03_RESEARCH artifacts
• RFC Integration: Design Lane and RFC processes work in conjunction

### Quality Assurance

• All files follow established naming conventions
• Proper markdown formatting throughout
• Required footer compliance (# UPGRADE) implemented
• Provenance tracking established

## Observations

### Platform Architecture

• Repository structure is well-organized with clear directory purposes
• Existing documentation standards are consistent and thorough
• Git workflow is optimized for collaborative development
• Integration patterns between directories are well-established

### Process Efficiency

• File creation workflow is streamlined
• Commit message standards are clear and semantic
• Directory navigation is intuitive
• Documentation templates reduce setup overhead

## Next Steps

### Immediate Follow-up

1. Monitor Design Lane adoption and usage patterns
2. Gather feedback on template effectiveness
3. Refine promotion pipeline based on real-world usage
4. Establish review process workflows
5. Monitor RFC process adoption alongside Design Lane

### Future Enhancements

1. Implement automated template validation
2. Create design note discovery and search capabilities
3. Develop metrics for design decision tracking
4. Integration with external design tools
5. Create cross-references between Design Lane and RFC artifacts

## Lessons Learned
