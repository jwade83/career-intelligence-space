# 2025-09-17 Captain's Log

## Intent

Reconcile local repository with GitHub after divergence and confirm successful synchronization.

## Actions

- Detected branch divergence between local `main` and `origin/main`.
- Executed `git pull --rebase origin main` to reapply local commits on top of remote.
- Verified no conflicts remained; confirmed clean working tree.
- Successfully pushed synchronized history to remote (`main`).
- Promoted Discovery opportunity artifacts (20250917_opps.md and 20250917_opps.csv) from 03_RESEARCH/opportunities/ to 05_EXPORTS/published/ using export process with provenance headers and # UPGRADE footers (2025-09-17Z).

## Status

COMPLETE — Local and remote repositories are now aligned.

## Next Steps

- Continue daily journaling of repo events.
- Monitor automation workflows for migration and journaling.
- Add provenance references for future migrations to keep logs consistent.

## Discovery Agent Schema Integration

### Intent

Design and register a first-draft workflow definition for automated opportunity discovery using modern agent schema.

### Actions

- Created agents/discovery.yml, matched CI and orchestration standards, committed schema to repo for versioned extensibility.
- Created tasks/queue/20250917-orch-discovery-test.yml orchestrator intake for Discovery Agent test run (Portland/Seattle/Remote) and committed to queue.

### Status

COMPLETE — Discovery Agent template in place, ready for orchestration and future enhancement.

## Daily Journal

- Orchestrator intake created for Discovery test run.
- Queue file committed and CI triggered.
- CI flagged missing headings; adding required sections to pass.
- Discovery run executed; opportunity files generated.
- Session digest created with comprehensive metrics and relative links for Discovery run analysis.

## Notes

- Discovery test scope: Portland/Seattle/Remote; keywords: maintenance technician, smart home, skilled trades.
- Keep Captain's Log narrative + this structured block for CI discipline.
