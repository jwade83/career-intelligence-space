# 2025-09-17 Captain's Log

## Intent
Reconcile local repository with GitHub after divergence and confirm successful synchronization.

## Actions
- Detected branch divergence between local `main` and `origin/main`.
- Executed `git pull --rebase origin main` to reapply local commits on top of remote.
- Verified no conflicts remained; confirmed clean working tree.
- Successfully pushed synchronized history to remote (`main`).
- Promoted Discovery opportunity artifacts (20250917_opps.md and 20250917_opps.csv) from 03_RESEARCH/opportunities/ to 05_EXPORTS/published/ using export process with provenance headers and # UPGRADE footers (2025-09-17Z).
- **SmartBuild Senior BMT Lead Chain Initialization**: Created complete research→synthesis→intelligence workflow chain for top-scored Portland BMT opportunity (SmartBuild Solutions, Score: 92/100).
- Generated queue files: 20250917-research-lead1.yml, 20250917-synth-lead1.yml, 20250917-intel-lead1.yml with full Bluestone chain structure and cross-linking.
- Created initial deliverable: smartbuild_senior_bmt_comp_scope.md with comprehensive compensation research framework and provenance tracking.
- Synth deliverables created for SmartBuild: table + brief
- Added Export Decision Reflection (v1.1) to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, preserving MP integrity while enabling CI export governance.
- **SmartBuild Intelligence Document**: Created 20250917_smartbuild_senior_bmt_intel.md with QA/compliance checklist framework, 6–24 month trajectory analysis, and cross-reference linking to pending comp table and brief deliverables.
- **SmartBuild promotion executed**: artifacts published to 05_EXPORTS/published/. Provenance: see session digest.

## Status
COMPLETE — Local and remote repositories are now aligned. SmartBuild workflow chain initialized with intelligence framework in place. Ready for research and synthesis phase execution.

## Next Steps
- Continue daily journaling of repo events.
- Monitor automation workflows for migration and journaling.
- Add provenance references for future migrations to keep logs consistent.
- Complete remaining SmartBuild deliverables (comp table, brief) via research and synthesis phases.
- Execute SmartBuild research→synthesis→intelligence chain workflow.

## Discovery Agent Schema Integration

### Intent
Design and register a first-draft workflow definition for automated opportunity discovery using modern agent schema.

### Actions
- Created agents/discovery.yml, matched CI and orchestration standards, committed schema to repo for versioned extensibility.
- Created tasks/queue/20250917-orch-discovery-test.yml orchestrator intake for Discovery Agent test run (Portland/Seattle/Remote) and committed to queue.

### Status
COMPLETE — Discovery Agent template in place, ready for orchestration and future enhancement.

## SmartBuild Lead Workflow Chain

### Intent
Initialize complete research workflow for top-scored Portland BMT opportunity from Discovery Report.

### Actions
- Identified SmartBuild Solutions - Senior Building Automation Technician as highest-scoring Portland lead (92/100).
- Created slug `smartbuild_senior_bmt` for consistent file naming and cross-reference linking.
- Generated full 3-phase queue workflow: research (Phase 1) → synthesis (Phase 2) → intelligence (Phase 3).
- Created comprehensive compensation research scope with market analysis framework, company intelligence objectives, and success metrics.
- Established provenance chain linking back to Discovery Report 20250917_opps.md.
- **Intelligence Phase Framework**: Generated intelligence document with QA checklist, trajectory analysis framework, and proper linking structure for workflow completion.

### Status
IN PROGRESS — Queue files, initial deliverable, and intelligence framework created. Research and synthesis phases pending execution.

## Daily Journal
- Orchestrator intake created for Discovery test run.
- Queue file committed and CI triggered.
- CI flagged missing headings; adding required sections to pass.
- Discovery run executed; opportunity files generated.
- Session digest created with comprehensive metrics and relative links for Discovery run analysis.
- SmartBuild lead workflow chain initialized with queue files and first deliverable.
- Intelligence document created with QA framework and trajectory analysis structure.

## Notes
- Discovery test scope: Portland/Seattle/Remote; keywords: maintenance technician, smart home, skilled trades.
- Keep Captain's Log narrative + this structured block for CI discipline.
- SmartBuild opportunity: $95K-$115K, Hybrid, Series B PropTech, building automation focus.
- Reflection documents rationale for keeping CI exports internal under 05_EXPORTS, with MP promotion reserved for intentional human review.
- Intelligence document includes pending QA checklist that requires completion of research and synthesis phases.
