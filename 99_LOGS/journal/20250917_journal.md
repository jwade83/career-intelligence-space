## Intent
Reconcile local repository with GitHub after divergence and confirm successful synchronization.

## Actions
- Detected branch divergence between local `main` and `origin/main`.
- Executed `git pull --rebase origin main` to reapply local commits on top of remote.
- Verified no conflicts remained; confirmed clean working tree.
- Successfully pushed synchronized history to remote (`main`).

## Status
COMPLETE — Local and remote repositories are now aligned.

## Next Steps
- Continue daily journaling of repo events.
- Monitor automation workflows for migration and journaling.
- Add provenance references for future migrations to keep logs consistent.

## Discovery Agent Schema Integration

### Intent
Design and register a first-draft workflow definition for automated opportunity discovery using modern agent schema.

- Created tasks/queue/20250917-orch-discovery-test.yml orchestrator intake for Discovery Agent test run (Portland/Seattle/Remote) and committed to queue.

### Status
COMPLETE — Discovery Agent template in place, ready for orchestration and future enhancement.
