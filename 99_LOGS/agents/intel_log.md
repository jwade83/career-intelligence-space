## Error Handling

### Common Error Patterns
- `source_unavailable`: Primary data source is inaccessible
- `rate_limited`: API or service rate limits exceeded
- `invalid_parameters`: Request parameters are malformed or incomplete
- `insufficient_permissions`: Access denied to required data sources
- `data_quality_low`: Retrieved data fails quality thresholds
- `timeout_exceeded`: Operation time limit reached

### Error Recovery Strategies
- Automatic fallback to alternative data sources
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation with partial results
- Human intervention triggers for critical failures

## Performance Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Average Response Time**: Target <10 seconds for routine queries
- **Source Reliability**: Track accuracy of each data source over time
- **Data Freshness**: Monitor age of collected intelligence data
- **Coverage Completeness**: Percentage of requested data points collected
- **User Satisfaction**: Actionability rating of intelligence reports

### Quality Assurance
- Cross-source validation for critical findings
- Confidence scoring based on source reliability
- Temporal consistency checks for trend analysis
- Bias detection and mitigation protocols

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- All PII redacted from intelligence logs
- Source attribution maintained separately from user data
- Encryption at rest for sensitive intelligence data
- Access controls based on classification levels

### Compliance
- GDPR compliance for EU user data
- SOC 2 Type II controls for data handling
- Regular security audits of intelligence collection processes
- Data retention policies aligned with legal requirements

## Alert Thresholds

### Performance Alerts
- Response time >30 seconds: Warning
- Response time >60 seconds: Critical
- Accuracy score <0.7: Warning
- Accuracy score <0.5: Critical
- Source failure rate >20%: Warning
- Source failure rate >50%: Critical

### Quality Alerts
- Data age >30 days: Stale data warning
- Confidence level D findings: Review required
- Contradictory findings across sources: Investigation needed
- Unusual pattern detection: Flag for human review

## Integration Points

### Upstream Systems
- Task Management System: Receives intelligence requests
- User Profile System: Contextual information for personalization
- Configuration Service: Source priorities and thresholds

### Downstream Systems
- Reporting Engine: Consumes intelligence findings
- Notification Service: Alerts on significant findings
- Analytics Platform: Performance and usage metrics
- Archive System: Long-term intelligence storage

## Monitoring & Observability

### Dashboard Metrics
- Real-time request volume and response times
- Source health and availability status
- Data quality trends and anomaly detection
- User engagement with intelligence reports

### Log Retention
- **Operational logs**: 30 days (high frequency debugging)
- **Performance logs**: 90 days (trend analysis)
- **Security logs**: 1 year (compliance requirements)
- **Intelligence data**: Variable based on classification
