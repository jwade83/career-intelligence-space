# Project 360° Sign-off Chronicle
**Date:** 2025-09-27  
**Repo:** career-intelligence-space

## High-Level Goals

### 1. Framework & Infrastructure
- Build a living knowledge system: GitHub repo with docs, chronicles, automation, and macros.
- Ensure self-documenting workflows: every major action produces artifacts (logs, chronicles, capsules).
- Treat Cursor + ChatGPT/Perplexity as agents in the workflow — not just helpers but repeatable processes.

### 2. Core Capabilities
- **Chronicles**: capture daily work, chats, and context in versioned logs (08_CHRONICLE).
- **Capsules/Specs**: deeper structured artifacts (derivatives analysis, reflexive capsules, specs).
- **Automation**: workflows (CI, frontmatter gates, link checks) + prompt macros to reduce friction.
- **Agents**: emerging role definitions (Edge Agent, Field Agent, Chronicler) tied into automation.

### 3. Strategic Outcome
- Create a portfolio-grade environment: a hybrid of personal operating system + professional development lab.
- Position it to scale: multi-agent collaboration, cross-platform pipelines, and long-term research/automation integration.

## Near-Term Milestones (1–4 weeks)
- Stabilize Cursor IDE as main driver: complete migration from Terminal copy/paste to Cursor macros.
- Harden docs compliance: ensure all new/legacy files pass frontmatter + link checks automatically.
- Prompts library: expand /prompts/ with daily workflow, rebase fixer, session checker, etc.
- Automation cross-linking: continue surfacing macros in docs so workflows are easy to rediscover.
- Chronicle cadence: maintain daily/weekly chronicles from both ChatGPT + Cursor exports.

## Medium-Term Milestones (1–3 months)
- Agent layer formalization: standardize the role of Cursor Agent, Chronicler, Edge/Field Agents.
- CI/CD refinements: streamline non-blocking vs required checks, improve PR auto-merge reliability.
- Capsule growth: expand beyond setup/logs into higher-order analysis (adaptive patterns, reflexive capsules).
- External integrations: explore linking Perplexity/Comet exports into the repo the same way as ChatGPT + Cursor.
- Scaling up: move from single-user workflows to structures that could support team collaboration if needed.

## Notes
- **Today's work**: Cursor integration + PR workflow hardening + prompts library creation
- **Keystone milestone achieved**: sustainable loop — draft in chat → export → pipeline via Cursor → PR → auto-merge → Chronicle
- **Foundation established**: From here it's about repeatability and scale: less remembering, more delegating, and building a system that grows stronger every day you use it.
