# 📱 Persistent Voice Input System

## The Problem with One-Off Files
- ❌ QUICK_INPUT.md gets reset after each use
- ❌ No history of previous voice notes
- ❌ Have to remember to use different files

## The Solution: Persistent Field Notes

**Use this file**: `08_CHRONICLE/capture_inbox/FIELD_NOTES.md`

## How It Works

1. **Open** `FIELD_NOTES.md` on your phone
2. **Tap** in the "Add New Note" section
3. **Use voice-to-text** to speak your thoughts
4. **Commit** the file
5. **Magic happens**:
   - ✅ New note gets processed into timestamped capture
   - ✅ Note gets added to "Notes History" section
   - ✅ Input area resets for next voice note
   - ✅ Everything is automated

## Persistent Features

- ✅ **Always ready** - input area never disappears
- ✅ **History preserved** - all previous notes stay in the file
- ✅ **Automatic processing** - each note becomes a separate capture
- ✅ **No reset** - file stays persistent and usable
- ✅ **Voice-to-text friendly** - just speak and commit

## Usage Examples

### Daily Voice Notes
- Morning thoughts
- Meeting notes
- Ideas and insights
- Quick observations

### Field Work
- Client conversations
- Project updates
- Problem-solving notes
- Action items

## Mobile Workflow

1. **Bookmark** `FIELD_NOTES.md` for quick access
2. **Voice-to-text** your thoughts
3. **Commit** (one tap)
4. **Repeat** anytime - file is always ready

## No More:
- ❌ One-off files that reset
- ❌ Losing previous notes
- ❌ Complex templates
- ❌ Manual file management

## Just:
- ✅ **One persistent file**
- ✅ **Voice-to-text input**
- ✅ **Automatic processing**
