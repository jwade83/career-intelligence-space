# üì± Mobile Workflow - Super Simple

## The One-File Solution

**Just edit this file**: `08_CHRONICLE/capture_inbox/QUICK_INPUT.md`

## How It Works

1. **Open** `QUICK_INPUT.md` on your phone
2. **Tap** in the content area (after "## Content")
3. **Use voice-to-text** (your phone's native keyboard voice feature)
4. **Speak** your thoughts - they appear automatically
5. **Commit** the file
6. **Done!** Everything else is automated

## What Happens Automatically

- ‚úÖ **New capture file** created with timestamp
- ‚úÖ **QUICK_INPUT.md** reset for next use
- ‚úÖ **PII scanning** and validation
- ‚úÖ **Lite archive** generated
- ‚úÖ **Traceability** maintained

## Voice-to-Text Tips

- **Speak naturally** - don't worry about formatting
- **Use punctuation** - say "period", "comma", "new line"
- **Edit after** - you can always clean up the text
- **Keep it conversational** - this is for capturing thoughts

## Example Usage

1. **Open** QUICK_INPUT.md
2. **Tap** content area
3. **Voice-to-text**: "Had a great conversation with John about the project. Key points: need to focus on mobile UX, timeline is tight, budget looks good. Next steps: schedule follow-up meeting."
4. **Commit**
5. **Done!**
