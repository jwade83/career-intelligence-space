- ✅ **Success Metrics System** - Comprehensive tracking and measurement framework
- ✅ **Antifragility Triggers** - Incident-triggered lens workflows operational
- ✅ **Repository Stability** - Gradual migration maintaining backward compatibility

**Stage A Implementation Status:**
- 🔄 **Week 1 Activation** - Currently implementing Stage A protocols
- 🔄 **Metrics Collection** - Establishing baseline for 6-week Stage A period
- 🔄 **Consistency Building** - Beginning regular lens usage patterns

### **Milestones**
**Achieved:**
- ✅ **Strategic Lenses System** (2025-09-29) - Complete implementation
- ✅ **Enhanced Framework** (2025-09-29) - ChatGPT stage-based progression
- ✅ **Stage A Activation** (2025-09-29) - Beginning 6-week Stage A period

**In Progress:**
- 🔄 **Stage A Implementation** - Week 1 of 6-week Stage A period
