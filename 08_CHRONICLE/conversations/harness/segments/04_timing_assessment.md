# Timing Assessment

## Context
Critical assessment of whether Harness implementation is reasonable for the repo and project at this point in time, considering current system maturity and strategic priorities.

## Key Points
- **Current system is working** - Stage B + career intelligence artifacts delivering value
- **Harness is premature** - Solving problems we don't have yet
- **Focus on validation** - Prove current system works before adding complexity
- **Resource allocation** - Time better spent on career intelligence

## Decisions Made
- **DELAY Harness implementation** for 3-6 months
- **Focus on current system validation** through real usage
- **Build career intelligence** using deployed artifacts
- **Track metrics** to measure effectiveness

## Next Steps
- Create comprehensive documentation for future implementation
- Establish conversation archive system
- Focus on validating current CIS system
