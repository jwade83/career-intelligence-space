# Implementation Strategy

## Context
Review and analysis of ChatGPT's implementation strategy, focusing on what fits cleanly in-repo vs. what needs external infrastructure, with pragmatic trade-offs and recommendations.

## Key Points
- **Repo-native components** - 80% of benefits with near-zero external surface area
- **Borderline components** - possible in-repo but with sharp edges
- **External infrastructure** - third-party services for scale and advanced features
- **80/20 rule** - minimum viable Harness entirely in-repo

## Decisions Made
- **ChatGPT's analysis is excellent** - pragmatic and implementation-focused
- **Most suggestions should be implemented** - with minor modifications
- **Focus on repo-native approach** - leverage GitHub's native capabilities

## Next Steps
- Assess timing for implementation
- Develop documentation strategy
- Create conversation archive system
