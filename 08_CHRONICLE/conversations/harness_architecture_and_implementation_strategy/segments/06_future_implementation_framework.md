# Future Implementation Framework

## Context
Establishment of framework for future Harness implementation, including readiness criteria, implementation triggers, and success metrics.

## Key Points
- **Implementation readiness criteria** - clear conditions for when to implement
- **Automatic triggers** - specific conditions that require immediate implementation
- **Manual triggers** - conditions that require evaluation and decision
- **Success metrics** - how to measure Harness effectiveness

## Decisions Made
- **Implementation delayed** until current system validated
- **Clear readiness criteria** established
- **Trigger conditions** defined for future implementation
- **Success metrics** outlined for measurement

## Next Steps
- Focus on current system validation
- Track metrics and identify pain points
- Implement Harness when conditions are met
- Use comprehensive documentation for implementation
