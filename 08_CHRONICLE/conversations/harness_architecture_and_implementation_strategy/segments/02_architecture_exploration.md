# Architecture Exploration

## Context
Comprehensive exploration of Harness component architecture, including detailed specifications for each component and how they work together to create an antifragile system.

## Key Points
- **Seven core components** identified: Ontology, Context Packs, Decision Log, Checkpoints, Chronicle, Agents, Automation Layer
- **Collapse risk neutralization** - each component targets specific failure modes
- **Implementation phases** - repo-native, borderline, external infrastructure
- **Practical examples** - how Harness would work in CIS context

## Decisions Made
- **Component specifications** documented in detail
- **Implementation strategy** outlined with phases
- **Collapse risk mapping** established for each component

## Next Steps
- Review ChatGPT's implementation analysis
- Assess timing and readiness for implementation
- Develop documentation strategy
