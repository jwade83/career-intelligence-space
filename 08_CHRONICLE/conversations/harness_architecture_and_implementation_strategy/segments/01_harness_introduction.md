# Harness Introduction

## Context
Initial introduction to the CIS Harness concept - a scaffolding system for long-term LLM memory designed to overcome inherent limitations and create antifragile project memory.

## Key Points
- **Seven Collapse Risks (C1-C7)** identified as core LLM limitations
- **Scaffolding features** designed as antibodies to specific collapse risks
- **Antifragility principle** - system gets stronger from failures
- **Externalized memory** - not dependent on token limits

## Decisions Made
- **Harness architecture exploration** approved for detailed analysis
- **Comprehensive documentation** approach for future implementation
- **Collapse risk mapping** established as core framework

## Next Steps
- Deep dive into architecture exploration
- Implementation strategy analysis
- Timing assessment for deployment
