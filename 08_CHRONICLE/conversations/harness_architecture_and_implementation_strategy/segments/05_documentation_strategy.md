- **Implementation readiness** - clear criteria and procedures
- **Future reference** - comprehensive materials for when timing is right

## Decisions Made
- **Comprehensive documentation structure** established
- **Conversation archive system** designed and implemented
- **Implementation readiness framework** created
- **High-priority improvements** identified and implemented

## Next Steps
- Implement high-priority archive system components
- Create conversation archive for current discussion
- Establish implementation readiness criteria
