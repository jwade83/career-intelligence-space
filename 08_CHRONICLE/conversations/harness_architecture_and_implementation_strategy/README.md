# Harness Architecture and Implementation Strategy Conversation Archive

## Purpose
This archive preserves the complete context and analysis from the 2025-11-10 Harness Architecture and Implementation Strategy conversation. The archive serves as a comprehensive reference for future implementation, capturing not just the decisions made but the full strategic thinking and rationale behind them.

## Navigation

### Core Archive Files
- **[Complete Conversation Archive](2025-11-10_full_conversation_archive.md)** - Full transcript with all context
- **[Key Insights Extraction](2025-11-10_key_insights_extraction.md)** - Strategic insights and analysis
- **[Implementation Analysis](2025-11-10_implementation_analysis.md)** - Timing and readiness assessment

### Conversation Segments
- **[01: Introduction](segments/01_introduction.md)** - Initial concept and context
- **[02: Deep Dive](segments/02_deep_dive.md)** - Detailed analysis and exploration
- **[03: Implementation Strategy](segments/03_implementation_strategy.md)** - Implementation approach
- **[04: Timing Assessment](segments/04_timing_assessment.md)** - When to implement
- **[05: Documentation Strategy](segments/05_documentation_strategy.md)** - How to organize
- **[06: Future Framework](segments/06_future_framework.md)** - Implementation readiness

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Harness implementation delayed** - Focus on validating current CIS system first
2. **Comprehensive documentation created** - For future implementation reference
3. **Conversation archive system established** - Preserve full context and analysis
4. **Implementation readiness framework** - Clear criteria for when to implement
5. **High-priority archive system implemented** - Production-ready conversation archiving

## Implementation Status
- **Current Status:** Documented for future implementation
- **Timing:** To be implemented when current CIS system shows need
- **Dependencies:** Stage B stability, career intelligence artifact validation
- **Readiness Criteria:** See [Implementation Analysis](2025-11-10_implementation_analysis.md)

## Archive Maintenance
- **Last Updated:** 2025-11-10
- **Next Review:** [To be scheduled]
- **Maintenance:** Automated via GitHub Actions
- **Search:** Use repository search with tags: `harness_architecture_and_implementation_strategy`, `conversation_archive`
