## üéØ Purpose

Transform the ChatGPT-proposed "jobs radar" concept into a streamlined, chat-first career intelligence system that enhances existing CIS capabilities. This capsule documents the strategic analysis, design evolution, and implementation roadmap for creating an effortless daily job market intelligence workflow.

---

## üåê Strategic Context

**Current State:** CIS operates as Stage B Quality Gatekeeper with comprehensive career intelligence frameworks but lacks automated job market scanning and action intelligence.

**Vision State:** CIS evolves to include automated job market intelligence with chat-first interaction, leveraging existing Perplexity capabilities and CIS infrastructure for seamless daily career opportunity management.

**Evolution Path:** Stage B (Quality Gatekeeper) ‚Üí Stage C (External Intelligence Integration) ‚Üí Stage D (Full Action-Execution-Intelligence Ecosystem)

---

## üìä Strategic Assessment: A+ Breakthrough Innovation

### **Core Innovation: Chat-First Career Intelligence**
The critical insight: **leverage existing chat behavior** rather than creating new interfaces, transforming job search from manual process to conversational intelligence.

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Chat-first interaction** - natural conversation with existing ChatGPT/Perplexity
- **Progressive enhancement** - start simple, evolve based on usage
- **CIS integration** - enhance existing frameworks rather than create parallel systems
- **Streamlined workflow** - 2-minute daily check-in with maximum intelligence

---

## üöÄ Design Evolution: From Complex to Streamlined

### **Original ChatGPT Proposal (Complex)**
- Multiple interfaces (chat, email, action card, dashboard)
- Complex JSON payloads and GitHub API integration
- Heavy automation with n8n flows and auto-merge rules
- Multiple failure paths and maintenance overhead

### **Streamlined CIS Enhancement (Simple)**
- **Single interface** - chat handles 90% of interactions
- **Leverage existing infrastructure** - Discovery Agent, Strategic Lenses, Chronicle
- **Progressive enhancement** - add complexity only when needed
- **Minimal maintenance** - uses existing CIS automation

---

## üéØ Implementation Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Chat-Only Intelligence (Start Here)**
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks  
**Complexity:** Low  
**User Experience:** Natural conversation with existing ChatGPT/Perplexity

**Core Workflow:**
```
You: "What's new in the job market?"
CIS: "Found 3 IMMEDIATE opportunities:
1. CRMG ‚Äî Maint Tech II ‚Äî $26-28/hr ‚Äî Why: work-order tech + electrical
2. Liberty ‚Äî Certified Maint Tech ‚Äî $28-30/hr ‚Äî Why: HVAC track  
3. Bluestone ‚Äî PT Facilities Tech ‚Äî $24-26/hr ‚Äî Why: part-time fit

Reply: apply 1, research 2, snooze 3d 3"

You: "apply 1, research 2, snooze 3d 3"
CIS: "Done. Applied to CRMG, created Liberty research stub, snoozed Bluestone until Friday. Check your email for confirmation."
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Enhance existing Discovery Agent with scoring algorithm
- Create Perplexity prompts for structured job scan reports
- Integrate with existing Company Research Template and Compensation Tracker
- Use existing Chronicle structure for job scan reports

### **Phase 2: Smart Email Digest (Weekend Project)**
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
