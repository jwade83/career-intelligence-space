# Sample Rollback Incident - Workflow Disable

**Date:** 2025-11-10
**Time:** 14:30:00
**Rollback Type:** Workflow Disable
**Workflow:** frontmatter-validation
**Reason:** Sample incident for documentation purposes
**Severity:** LOW (Sample)

## Actions Taken
- [x] Workflow file renamed: `.github/workflows/frontmatter-validation.yml` â†’ `.github/workflows/frontmatter-validation.yml.disabled`
- [x] Rollback incident logged: `08_CHRONICLE/incidents/2025-11-10_sample-rollback-incident.md`

## Verification Steps
