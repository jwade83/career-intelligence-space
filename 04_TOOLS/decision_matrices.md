## Advanced Decision Frameworks

### Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)

#### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Define the Decision Problem**
   - Clear statement of what needs to be decided
   - Identification of all viable alternatives
   - Timeline and constraints definition

2. **Identify Evaluation Criteria**
   - Brainstorm all relevant factors
   - Group related criteria
   - Ensure criteria are measurable
   - Check for independence between criteria

3. **Assign Weights to Criteria**
   - Use techniques like Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)
   - Pairwise comparison method
   - Direct rating method
   - Swing weighting technique

4. **Score Alternatives**
   - Use consistent scoring scale (1-10 or 1-5)
   - Gather objective data where possible
   - Use expert judgment for subjective criteria
   - Document scoring rationale

5. **Calculate and Compare**
   - Weighted sum approach
   - Sensitivity analysis
   - Scenario testing
   - Risk consideration

### Pros and Cons Analysis Plus (PCA+)

#### Enhanced Framework
| Factor | Pro/Con | Impact (1-10) | Probability (1-10) | Weight | Score |
|--------|---------|---------------|-------------------|--------|-------|
| Factor 1 | Pro | 8 | 9 | 8.5 | +68 |
| Factor 2 | Con | 6 | 7 | 6.5 | -39 |
| Factor 3 | Pro | 9 | 6 | 7.5 | +54 |
| **Net Score** | | | | | **+83** |

#### Scoring Method
- **Pros**: Impact × Probability × Weight = Positive Score
- **Cons**: Impact × Probability × Weight = Negative Score
- **Net Score**: Sum of all positive and negative scores

### Decision Trees for Career Choices

#### Structure Template
```
Decision Node: [Career Choice]
├── Alternative A: [Option 1]
│   ├── Outcome 1 (prob: 0.6): [Result + Value]
│   └── Outcome 2 (prob: 0.4): [Result + Value]
├── Alternative B: [Option 2]
│   ├── Outcome 1 (prob: 0.7): [Result + Value]
│   └── Outcome 2 (prob: 0.3): [Result + Value]
└── Alternative C: [Option 3]
    ├── Outcome 1 (prob: 0.8): [Result + Value]
    └── Outcome 2 (prob: 0.2): [Result + Value]
```

#### Expected Value Calculation

## Best Practices

### Decision Matrix Guidelines

1. **Criteria Independence**
   - Ensure criteria don't overlap significantly
   - Test for correlation between factors
   - Adjust weights for interdependent criteria

2. **Scoring Consistency**
   - Use the same scale across all criteria
   - Define clear anchoring points
   - Document scoring rationale
   - Consider using multiple evaluators

3. **Weight Validation**
   - Use multiple weighting methods
   - Test sensitivity to weight changes
   - Validate weights with stakeholders
   - Review weights over time

4. **Bias Mitigation**
   - Use structured processes
   - Include diverse perspectives
   - Challenge assumptions
   - Document potential biases

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Analysis Paralysis**
   - Set clear deadlines for decisions
   - Recognize when "good enough" is sufficient
   - Focus on high-impact criteria
   - Use time-boxed analysis periods

2. **Over-Weighting Recent Information**
   - Consider historical trends
   - Balance recent vs. long-term data
   - Use multiple information sources
   - Apply appropriate discounting

3. **Confirmation Bias**
   - Challenge preferred options more rigorously
   - Seek disconfirming evidence
   - Use devil's advocate approaches
   - Include skeptical perspectives

4. **False Precision**
   - Acknowledge uncertainty in scoring
   - Use ranges instead of point estimates
   - Focus on significant differences
   - Avoid over-interpreting small variations
