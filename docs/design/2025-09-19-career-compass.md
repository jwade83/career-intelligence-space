# Career Compass Enhancement

**Date:** 2025-09-19  
**Author:** Comet Assistant  
**Status:** Draft  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Context:** Speculative design note created as placeholder example for Design Lane scaffold implementation

## Executive Summary
This placeholder design note demonstrates the Career Compass enhancement concept - a hypothetical intelligent career guidance system that leverages AI-powered analytics to provide personalized career trajectory recommendations. This note serves as a concrete example of how the Design Lane framework should be utilized for capturing architectural decisions with proper provenance.

## Problem Statement
Career professionals often struggle with strategic decision-making due to information fragmentation, lack of predictive insights, and absence of data-driven guidance systems. Current career intelligence tools are reactive rather than proactive, limiting their effectiveness in strategic career planning.

## Design Overview
The Career Compass system would integrate multiple data sources (market trends, skill assessments, performance metrics) to generate actionable career insights through machine learning models, predictive analytics, and personalized recommendation engines.

## Technical Details
### Architecture
- **Data Layer:** Multi-source ingestion (LinkedIn API, job boards, market data)
- **Analytics Engine:** ML pipeline for career trajectory modeling
- **Recommendation Service:** Personalized guidance algorithms
- **UI Layer:** Interactive dashboard with visualization components

### Implementation
- Python-based ML pipeline using scikit-learn and TensorFlow
- React-based frontend with D3.js visualizations
- PostgreSQL for structured data, Elasticsearch for search
- Docker containerization with Kubernetes orchestration

### Dependencies
- External APIs: LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor
- Cloud services: AWS SageMaker, S3, RDS
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 integration
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana stack

## Decision Rationale
### Options Considered
1. **Option A: Rule-based system** - Simple logic trees for career recommendations
2. **Option B: ML-first approach** - Heavy machine learning with minimal rules
3. **Option C: Hybrid system** - Combination of ML insights with expert rules

### Selected Approach
Option C (Hybrid system) selected for balance between sophistication and interpretability, allowing for both data-driven insights and expert domain knowledge integration.

## Impact Analysis
### Benefits
- Enhanced career decision accuracy through predictive modeling
- Personalized recommendations based on individual profiles
- Proactive career guidance vs. reactive job searching

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk: Data privacy concerns** → **Mitigation:** GDPR compliance, user consent frameworks
- **Risk: ML model bias** → **Mitigation:** Bias detection algorithms, diverse training data

### Resource Requirements
- **Development:** 8-12 weeks, 3 engineers
- **Testing:** User acceptance testing, A/B testing framework
- **Documentation:** API docs, user guides, admin documentation

## Success Criteria
- 85% user satisfaction with recommendation accuracy
- 50% improvement in career goal achievement metrics
- System uptime > 99.5%
