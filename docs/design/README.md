# Design Lane

## Purpose
The Design Lane provides a structured framework for capturing, reviewing, and promoting design decisions and architectural notes within the Career Intelligence Space platform. This lane ensures design provenance, maintains quality standards, and facilitates knowledge transfer through structured documentation.

## Rules
1. **Provenance Required**: All design notes must include clear authorship, date, and context
2. **Template Compliance**: Use the provided DESIGNNOTE_TEMPLATE.md for consistency
3. **Review Process**: Design notes require peer review before promotion to published exports
4. **Naming Convention**: Files must follow YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md format
5. **Footer Compliance**: All files must end with '# UPGRADE' marker
6. **Version Control**: Design decisions must be tracked with clear change rationale

## Promotion Path
1. **Draft**: Initial design notes created in this directory
2. **Review**: Internal peer review and validation
3. **Refinement**: Incorporate feedback and iterate on design
4. **Export**: Promote approved designs to 05_EXPORTS/published/design/
5. **Archive**: Historical versions maintained for traceability

## Directory Structure
- `README.md` - This file (lane documentation)
- `DESIGNNOTE_TEMPLATE.md` - Standard template for design notes
- `YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` - Individual design notes

## Integration
Design Lane integrates with:
- CI/CD workflows for automated validation
- 05_EXPORTS/published/ for promotion pipeline
- 99_LOGS/journal for activity tracking
- 03_RESEARCH for design research artifacts
