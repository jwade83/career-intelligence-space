# Career Intelligence Space — Vision & Operating Charter

## Purpose
CIS is a living, automatable **career research & decision system**. It converts
free-form leads and interviews into structured tasks, comparisons, and decisions
with a verifiable chain-of-custody.

## Scope
- Role Evaluation & Scorecards (Role Nodes, CIS v1.3 scoring)
- Pipeline Comparisons (comp, growth, flexibility, benefits)
- Negotiation Prep (levers, scripts, timing)
- Upskilling & Trajectory (cert ladders, training budgets, role transitions)
- Status & Governance (auto STATUS.md, ADR/DECISIONS.md)

## Non-Goals
- Portfolio storytelling (lives in the **Master Portfolio & Career** project)
- Storing PII/secrets in repo
- Building a public SaaS (this is a personal control plane)

## System Boundary
- **ChatGPT:** thinking partner, drafting, canvas docs
- **Perplexity:** runs Orchestrator-style intakes; produces queue YAML
- **GitHub:** control plane; schemas, queues, CI validation, artifacts, logs

## Operating Model (high level)
1. **Ingest:** Capture interview/lead notes in ChatGPT → normalize to intake.
2. **Orchestrate:** Convert intake to `tasks/*.yml` (queue) with `agent_type: orchestrator`.
3. **Execute:** CI validates; Orchestrator spawns A1/A2/A3; deliverables emitted.
4. **Decide:** Update Role Node & scorecard; write the decision entry.
5. **Track:** STATUS dashboard and DECISIONS.md stay current.

## Workflows (v1)
- **Comparables Pull:** Find 8–12 higher-ceiling roles; rank vs baseline.
- **Stage-2 Normalization:** Fold interview facts into Role Node; rescore.
- **Negotiation Brief (opt-in):** If stance moves from slow-roll to engage.

## ID & Files (conventions)
- Role Node IDs: `role_<company>_<role>_<timebox>` (e.g., `role_bluestone_mt_2025q3`)
- Queue files: `tasks/YYYYMMDD-orch-<shortname>.yml` with top-level `queue:`
- Decision log: `DECISIONS.md` (ADR-lite, newest first)
- Status page: `docs/STATUS.md` (auto-generated by queue)

## Definitions of Done (DoD)
- Any task must specify `deliverables[]` and produce links/paths.
- Any decision affecting direction must be recorded in `DECISIONS.md`.
- Any new intake/queue must validate in CI (green run) before "live."

## KPIs (lightweight)
- **Coverage:** % of live leads with Role Nodes & scores
- **Velocity:** Median time from intake → decision brief
- **Quality:** % of tasks passing CI without revision; % decisions with ADR entry
- **Leverage:** # of negotiation levers captured per engaged role

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Schema sprawl →** keep `docs/TASKS.md` as SST + a single queue template
- **Drift/lost threads →** always update `DECISIONS.md` + run STATUS queue weekly
- **Over-automation →** require human OK before outbound emails/offers
- **Privacy →** keep PII/agreements out of repo; reference external stores

## Roadmap (phased)
- **Phase 1 (Now):** Docs pack, STATUS.md automation, Comparables & Stage-2 flows
- **Phase 2:** Auto-score helpers; negotiation brief generator; role taxonomy
- **Phase 3:** Recurring sweeps (market & pipeline refresh), semi-auto outreach drafts
