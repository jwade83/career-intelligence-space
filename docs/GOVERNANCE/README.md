# Governance Framework: Constitutional Layer

## 🎯 Purpose

This directory contains the **constitutional layer** of the Career Intelligence Space - the non-negotiable governance principles that prevent system collapse through enforced doctrine, not optional best practices.

## 🏛️ Constitutional vs. Mechanical Layers

### **Constitutional Layer (This Directory)**
- **Ontology enforcement** - Stable vocabulary prevents C3 drift
- **Decision provenance** - Immutable decision logs prevent C6 entropy  
- **Human approval gates** - Required for C5 goal creep prevention
- **Checkpoint recovery** - Explicit anchors prevent C7 fragmentation

### **Mechanical Layer (MCP + Industry Tools)**
- **Schema validation** - MCP enforces tool contracts
- **Deterministic I/O** - MCP provides audit trails
- **Tool calling** - LangChain manages state machines
- **Vector storage** - LlamaIndex handles retrieval

## 🧬 Core Governance Principles

### **1. Doctrine First, Tools Second**
> "Every tool must prove compliance with collapse prevention antibodies before integration."

### **2. Constitutional Supremacy**
> "No mechanical layer decision can override constitutional requirements."

### **3. Human-in-the-Loop for Critical Decisions**
> "AI proposes, human confirms for any action that affects external systems or public visibility."

### **4. Externalization as Constitutional Law**
> "Nothing important lives only in chat. All decisions must be externalized with provenance."

## 🛡️ Collapse Prevention Mapping

| Collapse Risk | Constitutional Protection | Mechanical Support |
|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **C1 Context Saturation** | Context pack requirements | LangChain context management |
| **C2 Instruction Dilution** | Charter enforcement | LangChain output parsers |
| **C3 Vocabulary Drift** | Ontology.yml + linter | MCP schema validation |
| **C4 Reference Ambiguity** | Stable ID registry | LlamaIndex metadata filtering |
| **C5 Goal Creep** | Human approval gates | MCP ACL enforcement |
| **C6 Evidence Entropy** | Decision log schema | MCP audit logging |
| **C7 Thread Fragmentation** | Checkpoint tags | LangChain state management |

## 🚨 Non-Negotiable Requirements

### **Every Integration Must:**
1. **Prove collapse prevention value** - Which C1-C7 risk does it mitigate?
2. **Maintain constitutional compliance** - Never override doctrine
3. **Support human oversight** - Critical decisions require human approval
4. **Enable provenance tracking** - All actions must be auditable

### **Every Tool Must:**
1. **Respect ontology constraints** - Vocabulary drift is forbidden
2. **Log decision rationale** - Evidence entropy is forbidden  
3. **Support checkpoint recovery** - Thread fragmentation is forbidden
4. **Require human gates** - Goal creep is forbidden

## 📋 Integration Checklist

Before adding any new tool or capability:

- [ ] **C3 Check**: Does it respect ontology.yml vocabulary constraints?
- [ ] **C6 Check**: Does it log decisions with full provenance?
- [ ] **C7 Check**: Does it support checkpoint recovery?
- [ ] **C5 Check**: Does it require human approval for external actions?
- [ ] **Constitutional Check**: Does it strengthen rather than weaken doctrine?

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Constitutional Layer is working when:**
- Vocabulary drift is impossible (C3 blocked)
- Decision provenance is complete (C6 prevented)
- System recovery is guaranteed (C7 prevented)
- Human oversight is maintained (C5 prevented)
- External actions are auditable (C6 enforced)

**The Constitutional Layer is the immune system. Every requirement is non-negotiable.** 🛡️
