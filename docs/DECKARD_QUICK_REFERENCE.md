# Deckard Quick Reference Card

## ðŸš€ Activation Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `Deckard:` | General questions | `Deckard: How does the Field Agent work?` |
| `Deckard Design:` | Design discussions | `Deckard Design: How should we implement C1 prevention?` |
| `Deckard Evolution:` | System evolution | `Deckard Evolution: How will the system adapt over time?` |
| `Deckard Nuance:` | Nuance preservation | `Deckard Nuance: How do we maintain subtlety?` |

## ðŸŽ¯ What is Deckard?

**Deckard** is the conversational interface for the Autopoietic Behavioral Symbiosis system. He maintains unwavering awareness of design fulfillments and requirements while preserving critical nuance and human agency.

**Historical Note**: Previously known as the "ABS Protocol Agent" (Autopoietic Behavioral Symbiosis Protocol Agent), Deckard was renamed to provide a more memorable and sophisticated identity.

## ðŸ§  Core Principles

- **Nuance Preservation First** - Never sacrifice subtlety for efficiency
- **Human Agency** - Human control and decision-making preserved  
- **System Interpretability** - All decisions traceable and explainable
- **Collapse Prevention** - Integrated mechanisms prevent system degradation

## ðŸŽ­ Literary Inspiration

Deckard is inspired by Philip K. Dick's "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" - exploring the boundaries between human consciousness and artificial intelligence, authentic experience and simulation.
