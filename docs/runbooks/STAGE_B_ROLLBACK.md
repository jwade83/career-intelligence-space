# SE Runbook â€” Stage B Rollback System
**Context:** Comprehensive rollback system for Stage B safeguards and automation to prevent system degradation and maintain CIS integrity.

**Trigger:** Any Stage B component causing friction, blocking legitimate work, or degrading system performance.

**Purpose:** Provide graduated rollback options from minor adjustments to complete Stage A reversion while maintaining auditability and antifragility principles.

## Rollback Ladder (Graduated Response)

### **Level 1: Workflow-Level Rollback**
**Purpose:** Disable specific problematic workflows while keeping others active.

**Triggers:**
- Single workflow causing >20% of failures
- Workflow blocking legitimate work
- Performance degradation from specific automation

**Steps:**
1. **Identify Problematic Workflow:**
   ```bash
   # Check workflow failure rates
   gh run list --workflow=frontmatter-validation.yml --limit=20
   gh run list --workflow=workflow-validation.yml --limit=20
   ```

2. **Disable Workflow:**
   ```bash
   # Rename workflow to disable
   mv .github/workflows/frontmatter-validation.yml .github/workflows/frontmatter-validation.yml.disabled
   
   # Commit the change
   git add .github/workflows/
   git commit -m "rollback: disable frontmatter-validation workflow due to [reason]"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verification:**
   - Confirm workflow no longer triggers
   - Verify other workflows still active
   - Check system performance improvement

### **Level 2: Selective Bypass**
**Purpose:** Enable emergency bypass for specific PRs while keeping safeguards active.

**Triggers:**
- Legitimate work blocked by overly strict validation
- Emergency fixes needed
- Temporary workaround required

**Steps:**
1. **Enable Bypass Label:**
   ```bash
   # Add bypass label to PR
   gh pr edit [PR_NUMBER] --add-label "bypass-safeguard"
   ```

2. **Update Workflow Logic:**
   ```yaml
   # In workflow files, add bypass check
   if: github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name != 'bypass-safeguard'
   ```

3. **Verification:**
   - Confirm PR bypasses validation
   - Verify label is properly applied
   - Check that other PRs still validated

### **Level 3: Gradual Rollback**
**Purpose:** Reduce enforcement strictness while maintaining core safeguards.

**Triggers:**
- System friction without complete failure
- User frustration with current strictness
- Need for temporary relaxation

**Steps:**
1. **Update Config File:**
   ```bash
   # Edit enforcement levels
   vim prompts/strategic_lenses/config.yml
   ```

2. **Modify Enforcement Levels:**
   ```yaml
   # In config.yml
   stage_b_enforcement:
     level: "lenient"  # strict -> lenient -> disabled
     frontmatter_validation: "warn_only"  # block -> warn_only -> disabled
     promotion_gates: "optional"  # required -> optional -> disabled
   ```

3. **Verification:**
   - Confirm reduced strictness
   - Verify core functionality maintained
   - Check user satisfaction improvement

### **Level 4: Stage Reversion**
**Purpose:** Complete rollback to Stage A configuration and functionality.

**Triggers:**
- Complete system failure
- Loss of user trust
- Critical blocking issues
- Emergency situations

**Steps:**
1. **Disable All Stage B Workflows:**
   ```bash
   # Disable all Stage B workflows
   mv .github/workflows/frontmatter-validation.yml .github/workflows/frontmatter-validation.yml.disabled
   mv .github/workflows/workflow-validation.yml .github/workflows/workflow-validation.yml.disabled
   mv .github/workflows/promotion-gates.yml .github/workflows/promotion-gates.yml.disabled
   ```

2. **Restore Stage A Configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Restore Stage A config
   git checkout stage-a-final -- prompts/strategic_lenses/config.yml
   git checkout stage-a-final -- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
   ```

3. **Verification:**
   - Confirm Stage A functionality restored
   - Verify all Stage B components disabled
   - Check system stability

## Rollback Timing & Windows

### **Safe Rollback Windows**
```yaml
safe_windows:
  weekend: "Saturday-Sunday (low activity)"
  maintenance_hours: "Early morning (2-6 AM local time)"
  low_activity_periods: "Holidays, planned maintenance windows"
  
  considerations:
    - No active PRs in review
    - No pending releases
    - Low development activity
    - Stakeholder notification sent
```

### **Risky Rollback Windows**
```yaml
risky_windows:
  active_development: "High PR activity, active development"
  pr_review_periods: "Multiple PRs in review state"
  release_cycles: "Pre-release, release, post-release periods"
  
  mitigation:
    - Coordinate with team
    - Send advance notification
    - Have rollback plan ready
    - Monitor system closely
```

### **Emergency Override**
```yaml
emergency_override:
  conditions: ["system_break", "critical_blocking", "security_issue"]
  timing: "any_time"
  requirements:
    - Immediate notification to stakeholders
    - Post-rollback incident report
    - RCA within 24 hours

   - Rollback type and level
   - Triggers that caused rollback
   - Actions taken and verification results
   - Impact assessment and lessons learned

### **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**
1. **Analyze Failure:**
   - What went wrong?
   - Why did it go wrong?
   - How was it detected?
   - What could have prevented it?

2. **Document RCA:**
   - Include in incident log
   - Update Stage B planning with lessons learned
   - Modify rollback triggers if needed

### **Reintegration Planning**
1. **Assess Recovery:**
   - When is it safe to retry Stage B?
   - What changes are needed?
   - How to prevent recurrence?

2. **Plan Recovery:**
   - Timeline for Stage B retry
   - Modified implementation approach
   - Enhanced monitoring and triggers
