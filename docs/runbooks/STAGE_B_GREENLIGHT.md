# ‚úÖ Stage B Green-Light Checklist

**Version:** v1.0  
**Date:** 2025-11-10  
**Owner:** jwade83  
**Scope:** Career Intelligence Space (CIS) ‚Äî Stage B Activation Verification

---

## üìå Purpose
This checklist verifies that Stage B safeguards and promotion gates are working as intended before declaring Stage B officially live.  
Every box must be checked, with evidence logged, to ensure **enforcement + rollback + monitoring** function together.

---

## üîç Verification Steps

### 1. Commit Safeguards
- [ ] Pre-commit hook blocks file missing frontmatter
- [ ] Pre-commit hook allows valid frontmatter files
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable

### 2. GitHub Actions
- [ ] `frontmatter-validation.yml` runs automatically on PRs
- [ ] PRs with invalid frontmatter are blocked
- [ ] `bypass-safeguard` label successfully overrides block
- [ ] `rollback-monitoring.yml` workflow visible in Actions tab and runs successfully

### 3. Issue Templates
- [ ] **Stage B Rollback Event** template appears under Issues ‚Üí New Issue
- [ ] All rollback fields (Triggers, RCA, Lessons Learned, Antifragility) are present
- [ ] Test issue created and closed to confirm audit trail

### 4. Chronicle Integration
- [ ] Time capsule committed in `08_CHRONICLE/vision/`
- [ ] Sample rollback incident committed in `08_CHRONICLE/incidents/`
- [ ] All new chronicle files pass frontmatter validation

### 5. Rollback System
- [ ] Workflow-level rollback tested (disable one workflow)
- [ ] Selective bypass tested (`bypass-safeguard` label)
- [ ] Gradual rollback documented (`config.yml` relaxation)
- [ ] Stage reversion script executes cleanly

### 6. Monitoring & Metrics
- [ ] Rollback monitoring workflow provides logs with no errors
- [ ] Stage B success metrics defined (`STAGE_B_METRICS.md`)
- [ ] Metrics dashboard/Markdown updated with current compliance

### 7. Documentation
- [ ] `docs/runbooks/STAGE_B_ROLLBACK.md` exists and matches repo reality
- [ ] `docs/runbooks/ROLLBACK_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` accessible for emergencies
- [ ] `docs/runbooks/PROMOTION_GATES.md` exists and is complete
- [ ] Green-light checklist completed and archived in repo

### 8. Promotion Gates System
- [ ] Promotion gate documentation complete (`PROMOTION_GATES.md`)
- [ ] Artifact maturity levels defined (draft ‚Üí in-review ‚Üí matured ‚Üí promoted)
- [ ] Lens review requirements documented for each artifact type
- [ ] Quality assessment criteria established

### 9. Strategic Lens Integration
- [ ] Lens review requirements defined for chronicle entries
- [ ] Lens review requirements defined for documentation
- [ ] Lens review requirements defined for templates
- [ ] Lens review requirements defined for research
- [ ] Lens review requirements defined for tools

### 10. Rollback Trigger Configuration
- [ ] Rollback thresholds configured in `config.yml`
- [ ] Automated trigger thresholds set (velocity, PR failure, review completion, system health)
- [ ] Manual trigger criteria documented
- [ ] Emergency trigger procedures defined

### 11. Metrics Baseline Establishment
- [ ] Stage B metrics tracking system active (`STAGE_B_METRICS.md`)
- [ ] Baseline metrics recorded for Week 1
- [ ] Success criteria targets defined
- [ ] Health dashboard indicators configured

### 12. System Integration Testing
- [ ] Frontmatter validation integrates with PR workflow
- [ ] Rollback monitoring integrates with issue creation
- [ ] Promotion gates integrate with chronicle system
- [ ] Metrics tracking integrates with lens system
