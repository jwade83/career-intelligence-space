## Decisions

### 2025-11-10 • DEC-001 • Harness Implementation Timing
- **Context:** Post-Stage B activation, exploring Harness scaffolding system for long-term LLM memory
- **Decision:** Delay Harness implementation until current CIS system is validated through real usage
- **Rationale:** Current system is working well; Harness would be solving problems we don't have yet; focus on career intelligence validation first
- **Alternatives Considered:** Implement Harness immediately; implement partial Harness components
- **Impact:** Maintains focus on career intelligence mission; prevents premature optimization; allows for data-driven implementation decisions

  - `08_CHRONICLE/conversations/harness_architecture_and_implementation_strategy/`
  - `08_CHRONICLE/vision/2025-11-10_CIS_Action_Execution_Intelligence_Ecosystem_Capsule.md`

### 2025-11-10 • DEC-002 • Harness Archive System Implementation
- **Context:** Need to preserve complex conversation context and analysis for future reference
- **Decision:** Implement production-ready conversation archive system with frontmatter linting and PII protection
- **Rationale:** Externalized memory system prevents context loss; structured archives enable future reference; automation reduces maintenance burden
- **Alternatives Considered:** Manual documentation; simple file storage; external tools
- **Impact:** Enables structured conversation preservation; provides foundation for future Harness implementation; maintains conversation context and strategic insights

  - `scripts/lint_frontmatter.py`
  - `docs/archives/harness-archives.md`

### 2025-11-10 • DEC-003 • Frontmatter Linter Implementation
- **Context:** Need automated enforcement of Harness schema to prevent vocabulary drift and reference ambiguity
- **Decision:** Implement frontmatter linter with CI integration for automated schema validation
- **Rationale:** Prevents C3 (vocabulary drift) and C4 (reference ambiguity) collapse risks; ensures consistent frontmatter across archives; catches issues early
- **Alternatives Considered:** Manual validation; post-commit hooks only; no validation
- **Impact:** Automated quality enforcement; early error detection; consistent archive structure; reduced manual maintenance

  - `.github/workflows/lint-frontmatter.yml`
  - `docs/archives/harness-archives.md`
