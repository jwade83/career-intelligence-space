# Career Intelligence Space: Prototype State Documentation

## üß≠ Current Development Phase: v0.3

**Status**: Early-stage prototype in active development  
**Purpose**: AI-assisted systems learning journal and workflow experimentation  
**Maturity**: Functional field capture with iterative improvements

---

## üéØ What This Repository Actually Is

This is **not** a finished product or polished system. It's a **living lab notebook** that demonstrates:

### Core Learning Objectives
1. **Learning in Public** ‚Äì Experimenting with how AI systems can structure information, workflows, and reasoning
2. **Process Literacy** ‚Äì Understanding how ideas become repeatable processes, even with AI-written code
3. **Reflexive Documentation** ‚Äì Building meta-awareness about how tools, prompts, and workflows evolve

### What It Demonstrates
- **üß© Learning Trace**: Shows how a non-coder collaborates with AI to scaffold working systems
- **üîç Transparency Artifact**: Each PR documents reasoning, failure, and iteration
- **üß∞ Prompt Library**: Reusable field-capture prompts and their evolution
- **üß† Case Study Seed**: Beginning of an open notebook on AI-assisted systems design from zero

## ‚öôÔ∏è Current Functional Capabilities

### ‚úÖ What Works Right Now
- **Field Capture Pipeline**: ChatGPT ‚Üí GitHub Copilot ‚Üí PR creation (with manual fixes)
- **Mobile Workflow**: Documented mobile capture processes
- **Template System**: Structured frontmatter and content templates
- **Chronicle System**: Session documentation and tracking
- **Agent Framework**: Deckard Protocol and field agent specifications

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (v3.3)
- **Ontology Mismatch**: Templates using `type: field_case` instead of valid ontology types
- **Frontmatter Validation**: Complex frontmatter structures causing PR failures
- **Branch Protection**: Some automated workflows blocked by repository settings
- **Template Testing**: No automated validation against CIS ontology
- **C3 Vocabulary Drift**: Some documentation uses non-canonical terms (see governance framework)

### üîß Recent Fixes Applied
- Corrected v3.3 template to use `mobile_copilot_field_capture` type
- Simplified frontmatter structure to avoid validation failures
- Documented workflow errors and corrective actions
- Integrated with existing governance framework (C3 vocabulary drift prevention)
- Aligned commit templates with learning philosophy

---

## ü™ú Development Roadmap

### Immediate Goals (v0.4)
- [ ] Fix remaining PR #100 frontmatter issues
- [ ] Test corrected v3.3 template with new content
- [ ] Validate all existing field capture files
- [ ] Implement pre-commit hook for template validation
- [ ] Align all documentation with C3 vocabulary drift prevention
- [ ] Integrate learning commits with decision logging framework

### Short-term Milestones (v0.5-v0.7)
- [ ] Two field captures that run clean from ChatGPT ‚Üí Copilot ‚Üí PR merge without manual edit
- [ ] Automated template testing against CIS ontology
- [ ] Complete Chronicle automation pipeline
- [ ] Mobile workflow optimization

### Long-term Vision (v1.0+)
- [ ] End-to-end field capture ‚Üí Chronicle automation
- [ ] Research publication on human-AI collaboration patterns
- [ ] Teaching/mentorship materials based on learning process
- [ ] Formalized knowledge infrastructure project

## üèõÔ∏è Governance Framework Integration

This project operates within a comprehensive governance framework designed to prevent system collapse:

### **Constitutional Layer**
- **C3 Vocabulary Drift Prevention**: All documentation must use canonical terms from `docs/GOVERNANCE/ontology.yml`
- **C6 Evidence Entropy Prevention**: All decisions must be logged with provenance in `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`
- **C7 Thread Fragmentation Prevention**: Checkpoint system maintains continuity across sessions

### **Ontology Compliance**
- **Valid Types**: `mobile_copilot_field_capture`, `mobile_copilot_technical_analysis`, `mobile_copilot_meta_insight`
- **Required Fields**: `project`, `type`, `status`, `updated`, `schema_version`
- **Enforcement**: Blocking linter prevents vocabulary drift at commit

### **Learning Integration**
- **Learning Commits**: Every commit documents the learning process, not just technical changes
- **Decision Logging**: All significant decisions are externalized with provenance
- **Meta-Documentation**: Process evolution is tracked and documented

---

## üß† Meta-Skills Being Developed

This project builds marketable skills that credentialed people often lack:

### Technical Skills
- **Human-AI Interface Design**: Understanding how to structure effective AI collaboration
- **Workflow Architecture**: Designing repeatable, documented processes
- **Systems Integration**: Connecting multiple AI tools and platforms

### Process Skills
- **Iterative Development**: Learning through failure and rapid iteration
- **Transparency Engineering**: Maintaining auditability in complex processes
- **Meta-Documentation**: Documenting the process of learning itself

### Professional Skills
- **Learning Portfolio Management**: Building evidence of applied curiosity
- **Process Literacy**: Understanding how ideas become systems
- **Reflexive Practice**: Building self-awareness about learning and development

## üéì Learning Commit Philosophy

Every change is treated as a "learning commit" that documents:
- **What was attempted**
- **What failed and why**
- **What was learned**
- **How the system evolved**

Example commit message:
```
docs: captured v3.3 workflow failure ‚Äî branch protection and ontology mismatch notes

- Identified incorrect type usage in field capture templates
- Documented frontmatter validation failures
- Applied corrective actions to template system
- Updated ontology compliance documentation
```

## üîç How to Interpret This Repository

### For External Viewers
- **This is a learning project**, not a finished product
- **Expect partial functionality** and iterative improvements
- **Focus on the process** rather than the current state
- **Look for patterns** in how AI collaboration evolves

### For Future Contributors
- **Read this document first** to understand the current phase
- **Expect to learn** through experimentation and failure
- **Document everything** - this is a learning journal
- **Focus on process** over perfect outcomes

### For AI Agents
- **This is early-stage prototyping** with active iterations
- **Expect ontology mismatches** and validation issues
- **Reference this document** when interpreting system state
- **Prioritize learning** over immediate functionality
