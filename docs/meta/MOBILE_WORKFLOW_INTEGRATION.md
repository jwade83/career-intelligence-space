# Mobile Workflow Integration with Meta Documentation

## Purpose
This document explains how the mobile workflow guides integrate with the meta documentation layer and learning commit philosophy.

---

## Integration Points

### **Mobile Workflow Guides → Meta Documentation**
- **Mobile One-Click Guide**: References prototype state for context
- **Mobile Fast Capture Guide**: Uses learning commit templates
- **Mobile Copilot Guide**: Integrates with ontology compliance
- **Mobile User Onboarding**: Explains learning portfolio approach

### **Meta Documentation → Mobile Workflows**
- **Prototype State**: Explains current mobile workflow capabilities
- **Learning Commits**: Provides templates for mobile captures
- **Governance Framework**: Ensures mobile workflows use canonical terms
- **Ontology Compliance**: Validates mobile capture types

---

## Mobile Workflow Learning Integration

### **Field Capture as Learning**
Every mobile field capture is treated as a learning opportunity:
- **What was attempted**: Specific insight or knowledge capture
- **What was learned**: New understanding gained from the source
- **How system evolved**: How this changes future capture approach

### **Mobile Commit Philosophy**
Mobile commits follow the same learning philosophy:
- **Learning Context**: What was attempted and learned
- **Technical Details**: Mobile-specific context and compliance
- **Meta-Insights**: How this informs mobile workflow evolution

---

## Ontology Compliance for Mobile

### **Valid Mobile Types**
- `mobile_copilot_field_capture` - General field captures
- `mobile_copilot_technical_analysis` - Technical analysis captures
- `mobile_copilot_meta_insight` - Meta-level insights

### **Required Mobile Frontmatter**
```yaml
---
project: Career Intelligence Space
type: mobile_copilot_field_capture  # Must be ontology-compliant
status: active
tags: [field_capture, mobile_copilot, learning]
source: [source_type]
captured_at: "YYYY-MM-DD"
generator: mobile_copilot
---
```

---

## Mobile Workflow Evolution

### **Current State (v0.3)**
- Functional mobile capture pipeline
- Learning commit templates implemented
- Ontology compliance documented
- Governance framework integration

### **Next Phase (v0.4)**
- Automated mobile workflow validation
- Enhanced learning context capture
- Mobile-specific decision logging
- Improved mobile user experience

---

## Mobile Learning Portfolio

### **Evidence Building**
Mobile captures contribute to learning portfolio:
- **Applied Curiosity**: Systematic exploration via mobile
- **Process Literacy**: Understanding mobile AI collaboration
- **AI Collaboration Skills**: Effective mobile AI partnership
- **Transparency Engineering**: Mobile workflow auditability

### **Research Value**
Mobile workflows provide data for:
- **Mobile AI Collaboration**: What works on mobile devices
- **Mobile Learning Patterns**: How mobile affects learning process
- **Mobile Workflow Evolution**: How mobile processes improve
- **Mobile Meta-Learning**: How mobile learning itself evolves

---

## Mobile Workflow Guidelines

### **For Mobile Users**
1. **Read prototype state** to understand current capabilities
2. **Use learning commit templates** for all captures
3. **Follow ontology compliance** for all frontmatter
4. **Document learning context** in every capture
5. **Reference governance framework** for canonical terms

### **For AI Agents**
1. **Understand mobile context** from prototype state
2. **Use learning commit philosophy** for mobile captures
3. **Ensure ontology compliance** for all mobile types
4. **Integrate with governance framework** for consistency
5. **Prioritize learning** over immediate functionality

---

*This integration ensures that mobile workflows contribute to the overall learning portfolio while maintaining consistency with the governance framework and meta-documentation approach.*
