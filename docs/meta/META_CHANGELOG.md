# Career Intelligence Space: Meta Changelog

## Purpose
This changelog tracks the intellectual and operational evolution of the Career Intelligence Space project, separate from GitHub's code versioning. It documents learning milestones, process improvements, and system maturity progression.

---

## Version History

### v0.3 - 2025-10-07
**Status**: ðŸ”§ In Progress  
**Theme**: Ontology Alignment and Process Documentation

#### Key Milestones
- âœ… **Prototype State Documentation**: Created comprehensive README_State_of_Prototype.md
- âœ… **Meta-Layer Architecture**: Established docs/meta/ directory for project-level reflection
- ðŸ”§ **Ontology Mismatch Resolution**: Identified and documented frontmatter validation issues
- ðŸ”§ **Workflow Error Analysis**: Documented v3.3 template failures and corrective actions

#### Learning Insights
- **Schema Validation Gap**: Templates need automated compliance checking
- **Complex Frontmatter Risk**: Simpler structures are more reliable
- **Process Documentation Value**: Meta-documentation improves system understanding

#### Technical Changes
- Created `/docs/meta/` directory structure
- Added prototype state documentation
- Updated main README with prototype context
- Documented ontology compliance requirements

#### Next Phase Preparation
- Set foundation for v0.4 milestone tracking
- Established learning commit philosophy
- Created framework for versioned meta-layer

---

### v0.2 - 2025-09-26
**Status**: âœ… Complete  
**Theme**: First Field Capture Success

#### Key Milestones
- âœ… **First Functional Capture**: Successfully completed end-to-end field capture
- âœ… **Mobile Workflow**: Established mobile copilot integration
- âœ… **Template System**: Created structured frontmatter templates

#### Learning Insights
- **Minimal Frontmatter Works**: Simple structures avoid validation issues
- **Mobile Integration Viable**: GitHub Copilot mobile can handle complex workflows
- **Process Documentation Critical**: Each step needs clear documentation

---

### v0.1 - 2025-09-19
**Status**: âœ… Complete  
**Theme**: System Architecture Foundation

#### Key Milestones
- âœ… **Repository Structure**: Established organized directory hierarchy
- âœ… **Agent Framework**: Created Deckard Protocol and field agent specifications
- âœ… **Documentation System**: Set up comprehensive documentation framework

#### Learning Insights
- **Structure Before Function**: Good organization enables rapid iteration
- **AI Collaboration Patterns**: Clear prompts and templates improve outcomes
- **Transparency Matters**: Documenting process improves learning

## Learning Commit Guidelines

### Philosophy
Every commit should document the learning process, not just the technical change. This creates a narrative of growth and demonstrates systematic thinking.

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

Learning Context:
- What was attempted
- What failed and why (if applicable)
- What was learned
- How the system evolved

Technical Details:
- Specific changes made
- Files affected
- Dependencies or requirements
```

### Examples

#### Successful Learning Commit
```
docs(meta): add prototype state documentation

Learning Context:
- Identified need for clear project positioning
- Learned that "unfinished" can be reframed as "learning in progress"
- Discovered value of meta-documentation for AI agent interpretation

Technical Details:
- Created docs/meta/README_State_of_Prototype.md
- Updated main README with prototype context
- Established versioned meta-layer tracking
```

#### Failure Learning Commit
```
fix(templates): correct ontology mismatch in v3.3 templates

Learning Context:
- Attempted to add complex frontmatter without validation
- Failed due to type mismatch with CIS ontology
- Learned that schema compliance is critical for automation

Technical Details:
- Changed type from 'field_case' to 'mobile_copilot_field_capture'
- Simplified frontmatter structure
- Added validation checklist for future templates
```
