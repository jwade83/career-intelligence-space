# Meta Documentation Index

This directory contains project-level reflection and governance documents that explain the "why and how" of the Career Intelligence Space project.

## ðŸ“‹ Contents

### Core Meta Documents
- **[README_State_of_Prototype.md](./README_State_of_Prototype.md)** - Current development phase and system capabilities
- **[META_CHANGELOG.md](./META_CHANGELOG.md)** - Intellectual and operational evolution tracking
- **[LEARNING_COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md](./LEARNING_COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md)** - Guidelines for learning-focused commit messages
- **[MOBILE_WORKFLOW_INTEGRATION.md](./MOBILE_WORKFLOW_INTEGRATION.md)** - Integration between mobile workflows and meta documentation

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The meta documentation layer serves as:

### For External Viewers
- **Project Context**: Understanding what this repository actually is
- **Development Phase**: Knowing what to expect from current functionality
- **Learning Process**: Seeing how the system and its creator evolve

### For Future Contributors
- **Onboarding**: Understanding the project's learning-focused approach
- **Contribution Guidelines**: How to participate in the learning process
- **Process Understanding**: Why things are done the way they are

### For AI Agents
- **System Interpretation**: How to understand the current state and capabilities
- **Context Awareness**: What this project is trying to achieve
- **Learning Focus**: How to contribute to the learning process

## ðŸ§  Meta-Learning Framework

This directory implements a meta-learning framework that documents:

### Process Documentation
- How the system was built
- What failed and why
- How understanding evolved
- What patterns emerged

### Learning Portfolio
- Evidence of applied curiosity
- Systematic approach to skill development
- Process literacy demonstration
- AI collaboration patterns

### Research Foundation
- Qualitative data on human-AI collaboration
- Methodology for iterative learning
- Transparency in complex processes
- Meta-awareness about learning itself

## ðŸ”„ Versioning

Meta documents follow the same versioning as the overall project:
- **v0.3**: Current phase with prototype state documentation
- **v0.4**: Planned milestone with full validation pass
- **v1.0**: Target milestone with complete automation

## ðŸ“Š Integration

These documents integrate with:
- **Main README**: References prototype state
- **Chronicle System**: Documents learning milestones
- **Agent Framework**: Provides context for AI agents
- **Research Pipeline**: Foundation for future publications
