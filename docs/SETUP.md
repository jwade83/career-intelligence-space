# Career Intelligence Space - Setup and Configuration

## Repository Structure

This repository follows a structured organization to support the Career Intelligence framework.

### Folder Naming Conventions

#### Top-Level Sections

The repository uses ALL-CAPS top-level section naming (e.g., `08_CHRONICLE`, `00_GOVERNANCE`, `01_GUIDELINES`) as an intentional design choice according to CI guidance. This convention:

- Provides clear visual hierarchy for major functional areas
- Distinguishes top-level organizational sections from content subdirectories
- Supports the numerical ordering system for logical navigation
- Maintains consistency with the Career Intelligence framework taxonomy

#### Subsection Naming

Within top-level sections, subdirectories generally follow kebab-case naming conventions unless specifically documented otherwise.
