SmartBuild Solutions is offering a Senior Building Automation Technician role in Portland with a salary band from $95K to $115K and a median of $110,760. This band aligns with regional market rates for advanced building automation specialists and reflects the hybrid on-site/remote expectations of a Series B PropTech startup. Entry-level compensation begins just under $95K, with the most competitive offers reaching $115K, largely driven by technical specialization and the company's equity and benefits package. Compensation benchmarks confirm this offer sits near the top of the Portland market. Candidates who bring both deep controls experience and modern IoT skills are positioned to negotiate toward the upper band.
