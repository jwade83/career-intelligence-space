# Export Staging (Governed)

This folder is the default publishing/staging area for CI-generated artifacts.

- candidates/: awaiting review
- published/: approved, internal canonical
- outreach/: ready-to-send packets

Every file must include a provenance line at the top and a single "# UPGRADE" footer.
Promotion to Master Portfolio is an explicit step (not automatic).
