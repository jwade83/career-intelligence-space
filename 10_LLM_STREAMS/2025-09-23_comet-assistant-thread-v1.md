# Comet Assistant Thread - Dual-Agent Protocol Discussion

> **Raw Thread Export v1.0 — Chronicle Integration Discussion**

## Thread Content

src="https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/pplx-full-logo-primary-dark%402x.png" style="height:64px;margin-right:32px"/># This was the chatgpt response:
Got it — thanks for sharing Perplexity's list. I'll keep this tight and practical:
Below is a single, ready-to-paste reply you can send back to Perplexity that answers A–I decisively and keeps both chats in lockstep.
Reply to Perplexity — CIS Chronicle Answers (A–I)
Working title: CIS Chronicle (Communications Layer)
Role: Outward-facing narrative track that synthesizes logs/repo/LLM sessions + real-world context so anyone can jump in mid-stream.
A) Connections & Interactions
Flows & handoffs:
Work happens in CIS sandbox (ChatGPT + Perplexity + repo).
Chronicler ingests LLM Session Digests + Action Logs and repo artifacts, then publishes a Chronicle issue.
Curated outputs (e.g., polished resume, case study) eventually graduate to Master Portfolio.
Triggers (create an entry when):
Weekly cadence (even if light).
Major PR merges / releases / structural changes.
New asset families (resume variants, case studies, dossiers).
Interviews / applications / networking events of note.
Decisions with downstream impact; crisis/fix retros.
Subtypes (with template tweaks):
Weekly Narrative (default newsletter).
Milestone Release (ship notes + "why it matters").
AMA/Community (Q&A + prompts).
Meta Reflection (process/trajectory review).
Backfill (forensic reconstructions).
B) Front-Matter / Indexing
```
Canonical ID: cis-chr-<yyyymmdd>-<slug> (e.g., cis-chr-20250921-pilot).
```
Front-matter must include: id, title, period, version, status, tags, summary, sources (paths to Session Digests/Action Logs), slug.
Draft marking:
Visible badge at top of body: > **FORensic Draft v0.x — dates pending verification**.
Filename may include _draft if desired; front-matter is the source of truth.
C) Sourcing & Provenance
Linkage: Each Chronicle includes a short Provenance section at the end listing:
LLM Session Digests/Action Logs used (paths),
Key commits/PRs (IDs),
External references (titles + URLs, if public).
Outside inputs (interviews/emails/IRL):
Add ext_sources: array in front-matter with type, descriptor, consent (yes/no), and sensitivity (low/med/high).
D) Privacy, Redaction, Review
Default redactions: emails, phones, home addresses, private links, surnames unless needed → [redacted].
Lifecycle: forensic-draft → draft → published
Drafts require at least one human review for privacy & clarity.
"Published" only after provenance check + link validation passes.
E) Feedback, Readership, Reflexivity
Feedback channel: Link each Chronicle to a GitHub Discussion thread ("Questions/Feedback for this issue").
Incorporation signal: Next Chronicle includes a "Reader Follow-ups" bullet list with links back to resolved/ongoing threads.
Reflexive practice: Every issue includes an Outside-In paragraph + Unknowns & Assumptions box.
F) Automation & Extension (first 3 touchpoints)
GitHub Action: on new/updated files under 10_LLM_STREAMS/**, open a draft PR that includes a Chronicle stub (pre-filled front-matter + skeleton sections).
Static site (optional): GitHub Pages / MkDocs Material to publish Chronicles; generate RSS/Atom feed for email syndication.
Link & spell checks: CI job validates links, front-matter schema, and redaction keywords before "published".
Agentization guardrails: require (a) provenance present, (b) link validation pass, (c) readability/"newcomer clarity" checklist before auto-publishing.
G) Presentation & Public Distribution
Publish outside repo when: status = published, privacy review passed, and min content met:
Opening Note, ≥3 Highlights, 1 Deep Dive, Horizon Watch, Provenance.
Handoff checks: privacy pass, link pass, and an explicit "OK to publish" checkbox in PR template.
H) Handling "Meta" Content
Monthly Meta Chronicle: reviews gaps, cadence, reader clarity, and course corrections.
