summary: >
  Chat focused on designing a “Chronicled Newsletter” for CIS: identifying
  deliverables, platforms, provenance, and a lossless workflow to turn LLM sessions
  into public-facing narrative artifacts.

## Highlights
- Defined outward-facing **newsletter/blog deliverables** with provenance.
- Compared platforms (GitHub Pages, Substack, Medium) → **Substack recommended** first.
- Established **two-tier record**: private, hashed vault + public digest/newsletter.
- Identified pain points: avoiding copy/paste; keeping audit trail intact.
- Confirmed use of **Traceability Matrix** for every Chronicle.

## Decisions
- ✅ Substack as initial publishing channel.
- ✅ SHA-256 required for each export; pointers in `POINTERS.md`.
- ✅ Traceability Matrix and redaction policy are mandatory.

## Notable insights (verbatim, ≤20 words each)
- “[L12] Define deliverables clearly; readers must jump in mid-stream.”  
- “[L18] Substack gives clean email + web with minimal setup.”  
- “[L22] Two-tier model: vault (lossless) and digest (readable), linked by hash.”  
- “[L28] Avoid manual copy/paste; standardize digests + action logs.”  
- “[L40] Chronicle ≠ raw log; it’s sourced, narrative context for outsiders.”

## Actions requested
- [ ] Produce digest + action log for each critical session (owner: JW; cadence: per session)
- [ ] Draft Chronicle pilot issue referencing hash + sources
- [ ] Prepare Substack skeleton mapped to Chronicle sections

## Artifacts
- Pointer: `10_LLM_STREAMS/POINTERS.md` (entry for this session)
- Vault: `vault://chatgpt/ChatGPT-Project newsletter strategy.md` (hashed)
