# Planning Session: Monday.com + Make.com Integration

## Context
- **Problem**: Need orientation within the project - scattered information across GitHub, external tools, conversations
- **Constraints**: Current repo structure, existing workflows, budget considerations
- **Timeline**: Planning phase, implementation TBD

## Research & Analysis
- **Market Research**: Monday.com vs alternatives (GitHub Projects, Linear, Notion)
- **Technical Options**: Make.com vs n8n vs Zapier vs Pipedream
- **Trade-offs**: SaaS simplicity vs self-hosted control, cost vs features

## Design Thinking
- **User Flow**: Raw input → Monday.com dashboard → Make.com automation → Structured output
- **Integration Points**: GitHub ↔ Monday ↔ Drive ↔ External tools
- **Success Metrics**: Reduced context switching, better project visibility, automated workflows

## Decision Framework
- **Criteria**: 
  - Solves orientation problem
  - Builds toward Harness architecture
  - Avoids glass ceilings
  - Cost-effective
- **Options**: 
  - Monday + Make (SaaS-simple)
  - GitHub Projects + n8n (Open-core)
  - Hybrid approach
- **Recommendation**: Start with Monday + Make, design for future migration

## Strategic Alignment
- **Tactical**: Immediate orientation solution
- **Strategic**: Foundation for Harness externalized memory
- **Bridge**: Solves current need while building future architecture

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create Monday.com workspace structure
- [ ] Design Make.com automation flows
- [ ] Map GitHub integration points
- [ ] Test with current project data
