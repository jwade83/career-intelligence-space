# Specialize First: Designing a Sustainable Portfolio Career

## Key Insight
Success in the new economy comes from **narrow specialization before diversification** — become known for one high-value outcome, then expand your range.

## Field Data
Logan explains that corporate jobs are declining as "portfolio careers" emerge — individuals mix multiple revenue streams such as advisory work, consulting, sprint projects, and fractional roles.  
From her expert panel, all successful professionals agreed: start by specializing narrowly, clearly defining your offer (problem, process, pricing, and audience).  
Once credibility is established, gradually layer other formats of work to balance stability (retainers) and scalability (digital products).
