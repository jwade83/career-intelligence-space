# Mobile Copilot Field Capture Test Execution Plan

## üéØ Test Objective
Systematically validate mobile GitHub Copilot's field capture capabilities and design a production-ready workflow.

## üìã Test Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Capability Validation
**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Objective**: Confirm mobile copilot can create files with proper frontmatter

#### Test 1.1: Basic File Creation
```
PROMPT FOR MOBILE COPILOT:
"Create a new file in 00_SANDBOX/agent_inbox/ called mobile_copilot_test_basic.md with the following content:

# Mobile Copilot Basic Test

This is a test file created by mobile GitHub Copilot to validate field capture capabilities.

## Test Results
- [ ] File created successfully
- [ ] Frontmatter compliant
- [ ] Content properly formatted

## Next Steps
- Validate file creation
- Check frontmatter compliance
- Test content quality"
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] File exists in `00_SANDBOX/agent_inbox/`
- [ ] Frontmatter matches exactly
- [ ] Content is properly formatted
- [ ] Branch created (check branch name)

#### Test 1.2: Branch Strategy Test
```
PROMPT FOR MOBILE COPILOT:
"Create a file in the main branch (not a new branch) called mobile_copilot_main_branch_test.md with content about testing direct main branch writes. Use proper frontmatter and explain the implications of writing directly to main."
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] File created in main branch
- [ ] No new branch created
- [ ] Content explains branch strategy

### Phase 2: Advanced Content Generation
**Duration**: 20 minutes
**Objective**: Test sophisticated content generation capabilities

#### Test 2.1: Technical Architecture Analysis
```
PROMPT FOR MOBILE COPILOT:
"Create a technical analysis file in 00_SANDBOX/systems/ called mobile_copilot_architecture_analysis.md with a comprehensive analysis of the Career Intelligence Space repository architecture, including:

1. System components and their relationships
2. Data flow patterns
3. Integration points
4. Scalability considerations
5. Security implications

Use proper CIS frontmatter and structure the content professionally."
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Technical content quality
- [ ] Proper system analysis
- [ ] CIS frontmatter compliance
- [ ] Professional structure

#### Test 2.2: Template Compliance Test
```
PROMPT FOR MOBILE COPILOT:
"Create a file in 00_SANDBOX/meta_insights/ called mobile_copilot_meta_analysis.md using the exact CIS template for meta_insight_tracking type. Include analysis of the repository's evolution patterns and provide insights about the mobile copilot integration."
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Exact frontmatter match with CIS ontology
- [ ] Proper meta_insight_tracking type
- [ ] Content matches template structure
- [ ] Insights are valuable and relevant

### Phase 3: Batch Operations
**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Objective**: Test multiple file creation capabilities

#### Test 3.1: Multi-File Creation
```
PROMPT FOR MOBILE COPILOT:
"Create three related files in 00_SANDBOX/agent_inbox/:
1. mobile_copilot_test_001.md - Basic test file
2. mobile_copilot_test_002.md - Intermediate test file
3. mobile_copilot_test_003.md - Advanced test file

Each should have proper frontmatter and reference the others. This tests batch file creation capabilities."
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] All three files created
- [ ] Proper frontmatter in each
- [ ] Cross-references between files
- [ ] Consistent naming pattern

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
**Duration**: 10 minutes
**Objective**: Test integration with existing workflows

#### Test 4.1: CI/CD Integration
- [ ] Check if files trigger CI/CD workflows
- [ ] Validate frontmatter validation passes
- [ ] Confirm branch protection rules apply

#### Test 4.2: Repository Integration
- [ ] Verify files appear in repository
- [ ] Check commit history
- [ ] Validate branch management

## üîß Validation Tools

### Automated Validation
```bash
# Run validation script
python3 validate_mobile_copilot_tests.py

# Check frontmatter compliance
python3 .github/scripts/frontmatter_gate.py

# Validate CIS ontology
python3 scripts/validate_cis_ontology.py
```

### Manual Validation
1. **File Existence**: Check all test files exist
2. **Content Quality**: Review generated content
3. **Frontmatter Compliance**: Verify YAML structure
4. **Branch Management**: Check branch creation patterns
5. **Repository Integration**: Verify commits and history

## üìä Success Metrics

### Minimum Viable Field Capture
- [ ] Can create files with proper frontmatter
- [ ] Can access multiple repo directories
- [ ] Can generate structured content
- [ ] Can create appropriate branches

### Advanced Field Capture
- [ ] Perfect CIS ontology compliance
- [ ] Complex technical content generation
- [ ] Automated branch management
- [ ] Integration with existing workflows

## üöÄ Next Steps After Testing

### If Tests Pass
1. **Design Production Workflow**
   - Standardize field capture schema
   - Create automation pipeline
   - Implement multi-agent integration

2. **Create Mobile Copilot Integration**
   - Mobile-first capture templates
   - Automated PR creation
   - CI/CD integration

3. **Document Best Practices**
   - Mobile copilot usage guidelines
   - Field capture protocols
   - Integration patterns

### If Tests Fail
1. **Identify Limitations**
   - Document specific failures
   - Understand permission requirements
   - Map accessible vs. restricted features

2. **Design Workarounds**
   - Alternative capture methods
   - Hybrid mobile/web workflows
   - Manual integration processes

## üìù Test Results Documentation

After each test phase, document:
- **Test Results**: Pass/Fail for each criterion
- **Observations**: What worked and what didn't
- **Limitations**: Identified constraints
- **Recommendations**: Next steps and improvements
