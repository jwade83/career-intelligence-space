# Exploration Templates for Sandboxing Phase

## Purpose
These templates support **divergent thinking** during the sandboxing phase, focusing on exploration, hypothesis testing, and process capture rather than premature summarization.

## Template Philosophy
- **Guide, don't constrain** - Provide structure without limiting creativity
- **Capture process, not just outcomes** - Focus on how we explore, not just what we find
- **Preserve fragile insights** - Ensure important discoveries aren't lost
- **Support interrelatedness** - Help capture complex system relationships

## Template Types

### 1. Exploration Log (`TEMPLATE_exploration_log.md`)
**Purpose**: Capture the full exploration journey
**Use When**: Exploring new systems, concepts, or approaches
**Focus**: What we're exploring, how we're exploring, what we're learning

### 2. Hypothesis Tracking (`TEMPLATE_hypothesis_tracking.md`)
**Purpose**: Track and test specific hypotheses
**Use When**: Testing specific ideas or assumptions
**Focus**: Hypothesis statement, testing plan, results, implications

### 3. Process Capture (`TEMPLATE_process_capture.md`)
**Purpose**: Document methodologies and approaches
**Use When**: Developing or refining processes
**Focus**: Process steps, tools, execution, improvements

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use These Templates
- **During sandboxing phase** - When exploring and discovering
- **Before implementation** - When planning and designing
- **During creative sessions** - When brainstorming and ideating
- **When testing approaches** - When experimenting with methods

### When NOT to Use These Templates
- **During implementation** - Use production templates instead
- **For final decisions** - Use decision or capsule templates
- **For status updates** - Use log or memo templates
- **For specifications** - Use spec templates

## Template Customization

### Required Sections
All templates include:
- **Context for Future Recall** - Why this matters
- **Key Context** - Important background
- **Fragile Insights** - Easily lost discoveries

### Optional Sections
Templates can be customized by:
- Adding specific sections for your domain
- Removing sections that don't apply
- Modifying questions to fit your context

## Integration with Phase System

### Sandboxing Phase (Divergent Thinking)
- **Primary**: Exploration logs, hypothesis tracking
- **Secondary**: Process capture, creative sessions
- **Avoid**: Capsules, summaries, final decisions

### Design Phase (Convergent Thinking)
- **Primary**: Capsules, assessments, decisions
- **Secondary**: Process capture (for methodology)
- **Avoid**: Pure exploration logs

### Implementation Phase (Production)
- **Primary**: Logs, memos, implementation capsules
- **Secondary**: Process capture (for operations)
- **Avoid**: Exploration logs, hypothesis tracking

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Template, Adapt as Needed
- Use template as starting point
- Modify sections for your specific context
- Don't feel constrained by structure

### 2. Focus on Process, Not Just Outcomes
- Capture how you explored, not just what you found
- Document the journey, not just the destination
- Preserve the thinking process

### 3. Maintain Interrelatedness Awareness
- Always consider system connections
- Document cascading effects
- Track timing dependencies

### 4. Preserve Fragile Insights
- Capture insights that could be lost
- Document context that might be forgotten
- Record "aha" moments and breakthroughs

## Template Selection Guide

| Situation | Primary Template | Secondary Template |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Exploring new system | Exploration Log | Process Capture |
| Testing specific idea | Hypothesis Tracking | Exploration Log |
| Developing methodology | Process Capture | Exploration Log |
| Creative brainstorming | Exploration Log | Creative Session |
| Analyzing constraints | Constraint Analysis | Exploration Log |
| Mapping relationships | Interrelatedness Map | Exploration Log |

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Additions
- **Creative Session Template** - For brainstorming and ideation
- **Constraint Analysis Template** - For technical corner avoidance
- **Timing Exploration Template** - For sequencing and dependencies
- **Interrelatedness Map Template** - For system relationship mapping

### Integration Opportunities
- **LLM Context Optimization** - Templates optimized for AI consumption
- **Automated Processing** - Templates that support automated analysis
- **Cross-Reference Linking** - Templates that link to related explorations
