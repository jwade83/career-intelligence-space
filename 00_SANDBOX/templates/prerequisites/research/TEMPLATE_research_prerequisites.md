# Research Prerequisites Template

## Purpose
Guide thinking about investigation and analysis work without constraining exploration.

## Prerequisite Questions (Answer as you explore)

### 1. Research Scope
- **What are we investigating?** (Research question and scope)
- **Why is this important?** (Relevance and value)
- **What are the boundaries?** (What's in scope, what's out)
- **What's the timeline?** (When do we need answers)

### 2. Information Sources
- **What sources do we have?** (Available information)
- **What sources do we need?** (Missing information)
- **How reliable are the sources?** (Source quality assessment)
- **What are the limitations?** (Source constraints and biases)

### 3. Analysis Framework
- **How will we analyze the information?** (Analysis approach)
- **What criteria will we use?** (Evaluation standards)
- **What comparisons will we make?** (Comparative analysis)
- **What patterns are we looking for?** (Pattern recognition)

### 4. Assumptions and Biases
- **What are we assuming?** (Key assumptions)
- **What biases might affect us?** (Potential biases)
- **How do we validate assumptions?** (Assumption testing)
- **How do we mitigate biases?** (Bias reduction strategies)

### 5. Uncertainty and Gaps
- **What don't we know?** (Knowledge gaps)
- **What can't we know?** (Unknowable factors)
- **How do we handle uncertainty?** (Uncertainty management)
- **What additional research is needed?** (Follow-up research)

### 6. Implications and Applications
- **What does this mean for our project?** (Project implications)
- **How does this affect our decisions?** (Decision impact)
- **What are the risks and opportunities?** (Risk/opportunity analysis)
- **How do we apply this knowledge?** (Application strategy)

### 7. Validation and Verification
- **How do we verify our findings?** (Verification approach)
- **What evidence supports our conclusions?** (Evidence assessment)
- **What evidence contradicts our conclusions?** (Contradictory evidence)
- **How confident are we in our findings?** (Confidence assessment)

### 8. Communication and Documentation
- **How do we present our findings?** (Communication strategy)
- **Who needs to know about this?** (Stakeholder identification)
- **What format works best?** (Documentation format)
- **How do we make this actionable?** (Actionability)

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Research scope clearly defined
- [ ] Information sources identified
- [ ] Analysis framework established
- [ ] Assumptions and biases considered
- [ ] Uncertainty and gaps acknowledged
- [ ] Implications and applications explored
- [ ] Validation and verification planned
- [ ] Communication strategy defined

## Notes
- **Stay curious** - Don't stop at the first answer
- **Question everything** - Challenge assumptions and conclusions
- **Document uncertainty** - Note what you don't know
- **Think critically** - Consider alternative explanations
- **Stay open** - Be willing to change your mind
