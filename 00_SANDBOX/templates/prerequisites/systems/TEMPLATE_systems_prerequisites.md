# Systems Prerequisites Template

## Purpose
Guide thinking about interrelated systems without constraining exploration.

## Prerequisite Questions (Answer as you explore)

### 1. System Boundaries
- **What is this system?** (Define scope and purpose)
- **What is it NOT?** (Define boundaries and exclusions)
- **Why does it exist?** (Core value and rationale)

### 2. Dependencies & Connections
- **What feeds this system?** (Inputs and dependencies)
- **What does this system feed?** (Outputs and downstream effects)
- **What are the critical connections?** (Key integration points)

### 3. Cascading Effects
- **If this changes, what breaks?** (Negative cascades)
- **If this changes, what improves?** (Positive cascades)
- **What unexpected things might happen?** (Unintended consequences)

### 4. Timing & Sequencing
- **What must happen before this?** (Prerequisites)
- **What must happen after this?** (Dependencies)
- **What are the critical windows?** (Deployment, testing, rollback)

### 5. Technical Corners
- **What paths does this open?** (Future capabilities)
- **What paths does this close?** (Limitations and constraints)
- **How do we preserve options?** (Mitigation strategies)

### 6. Future Scaling
- **How does this affect Stage B → C → D?** (Evolution impact)
- **What additional work will this require?** (Future dependencies)
- **What assumptions are we making?** (Key assumptions)

### 7. Integration Points
- **How does this connect now?** (Current integration)
- **How will this connect later?** (Planned integration)
- **How might this connect in the future?** (Potential integration)

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] System boundaries clearly defined
- [ ] Dependencies mapped
- [ ] Cascading effects considered
- [ ] Timing constraints identified
- [ ] Technical corners analyzed
- [ ] Future scaling considered
- [ ] Integration points defined
- [ ] Assumptions documented

## Notes
- **Don't force answers** - If something doesn't apply, note why
- **Explore freely** - Use this as a thinking guide, not a rigid form
- **Document uncertainty** - Note what you don't know yet
- **Iterate** - Come back and refine as understanding grows
