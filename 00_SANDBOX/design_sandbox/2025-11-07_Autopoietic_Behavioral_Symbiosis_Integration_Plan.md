# Autopoietic Behavioral Symbiosis Integration Plan

## Executive Summary

This integration plan redesigns the Behavioral Symbiosis system to incorporate sophisticated mechanisms from precursor systems, creating a **truly autopoietic system** that can prevent its own collapse while enabling recursive self-organization.
