# Parallel Review Project: Scope Drift vs Career Specialization

## Project Overview

**Project Type**: Meta-Cognitive Review Project (Silo'd)
**Status**: Active - Awaiting Resolution
**Purpose**: Resolve the tension between scope drift concerns and career specialization thesis through parallel analysis

## Core Question

**Are we experiencing scope drift from career intelligence mission, or are we specializing in systems/AI-orchestration as a career vector?**

## Project Context

### **Trigger Event**
- Barometer review identified scope drift concerns
- Recent sandboxing work focused on meta-cognitive systems, autopoietic evolution, emergent agents
- Need for parallel validation of scope alignment assessment

### **Key Tension**
- **Scope Drift Thesis**: Recent work serves system maintenance rather than career intelligence
- **Career Specialization Thesis**: Systems-building IS the career vector for AI/systems roles
- **Resolution Needed**: Falsifiable framework to determine which is correct

## Analysis Results

### **Cursor Assistant Analysis (Original)**
**Key Findings:**
- Scope drift identified: Recent work shifted from career tools to meta-systems
- Agents are system-focused (Repository Guardian, Meta-Insight Catalyst) rather than career-focused
- Autopoietic evolution serves system architecture, not career development
- Meta-cognitive systems becoming ends rather than means

**Recommendations:**
- Reframe agent architecture to career-focused agents
- Validate career value for all new capabilities
- Balance exploration with career-focused implementation
- Create career-focused agents (Career Opportunity Scout, Career Strategy Advisor)

### **ChatGPT Analysis (Parallel)**
**Key Findings:**
- Drift signals are real but may represent career specialization
- Systems-building is legitimate career vector for AI/systems roles
- Meta-system artifacts can be portfolio assets if externally legible
- Process mastery (phase-aware thinking, collapse prevention) is interview evidence

**Framework Proposed:**
- **Tranche 0**: Mission Litmus (60-second recruiter test)
- **Tranche 1**: Dual-Track Interpretation (system + career readings)
- **Tranche 2**: Minimal Contrast Experiments (A/B test meta vs career)
- **Tranche 3**: Externalization Test (outsider validation)
- **Tranche 4**: Stop-loss & Asymmetric Bets (governance rules)

## Current Status

### **Where We Are**
- Parallel analysis completed
- Two competing frameworks identified
- Need for resolution through testing
- Project temporarily silo'd for experimental treatment

### **Next Steps Required**
1. **Decision Point**: Accept career specialization thesis or maintain scope drift concerns
2. **Testing Phase**: Implement tranche framework to validate career specialization
3. **Bridge Actions**: If career specialization accepted, implement 7-day bridge sprint
4. **Resolution**: Determine final approach based on test results

## Key Insights Preserved

### **From Cursor Assistant**
- Scope drift is real and concerning
- Career intelligence mission getting diluted
- Need for career-focused agents
- Balance between exploration and implementation

### **From ChatGPT**
- Systems-building as career specialization
- Falsifiable testing framework
- External legibility as validation
- Process mastery as differentiator

### **From Downloads Analysis**
- Nuance preservation is critical
- Real-time self-awareness is innovation
- Process vs. output distinction
- Human-AI collaboration protocols

## Project Naming Convention

**Project Type**: Meta-Cognitive Review Project
**Naming Pattern**: `[Date]_[Project_Type]_[Focus_Area]`
**Silo Status**: Temporary isolation for experimental treatment
**Recovery Method**: Project capsule with full context preservation

## Recovery Instructions

### **To Reactivate This Project**
1. Open `00_SANDBOX/projects/2025-10-03_Parallel_Review_Project.md`
2. Review the two competing analyses
3. Decide on testing approach (tranche framework vs. scope correction)
4. Implement chosen resolution
5. Document results and close project

### **Key Files to Reference**
- All 11 documents listed above
- This project capsule
- Barometer review system
- ChatGPT prompt for re-analysis if needed

## Experimental Status

**Silo'd for Critical Analysis**: This project is temporarily isolated to allow for experimental treatment of the competing theses without affecting main repository development.

**Risk Management**: Project isolation prevents scope drift from affecting core career intelligence mission while allowing thorough analysis of career specialization thesis.
