# Exploration Log: Phase-Appropriate Documentation System

## What We're Exploring
**Hypothesis**: Phase-appropriate documentation prevents premature summarization during creative exploration

**Context**: We've identified that using production documentation practices (capsules, summaries) during sandboxing phase creates premature convergence and loses nuanced process details

**Scope**: Testing the new exploration-focused file types and templates to see if they better support divergent thinking

## How We're Exploring
**Method**: Template-based exploration with phase-specific metadata

**Tools**: New exploration templates, updated ONTOLOGY.yml, phase-specific frontmatter

**Constraints**: Must maintain the "in-formation" philosophy while adding structure

## What We're Learning
**Insights Discovered**:
- The new exploration_log type feels more appropriate for sandboxing than capsule
- Phase-specific metadata helps clarify the thinking mode
- Templates provide structure without constraining creativity
- The interrelatedness focus is preserved in the new system

**Questions Raised**:
- Will this prevent the premature summary problem we identified?
- How will this integrate with existing CI/CD workflows?
- Will LLMs be able to use these templates effectively?

**Surprises/Unexpected Findings**:
- The frontmatter templates are more comprehensive than expected
- The phase workflow document provides clear guidance
- The system feels more aligned with our philosophical approach

## Interrelatedness Discovered
**Direct Connections**:
- ONTOLOGY.yml → Frontmatter templates → Phase workflows
- Exploration templates → Phase-specific thinking → Documentation quality
- Sandboxing phase → Design phase → Implementation phase

**Cascading Effects**:
- If we use exploration_log during sandboxing, we preserve process details
- If we use capsule during design, we focus on decisions
- If we use log during implementation, we track execution

**Timing Dependencies**:
- Must complete exploration before moving to design
- Must complete design before moving to implementation
- Each phase builds on the previous phase's outputs

## Next Exploration Steps
**Immediate Next Steps**:
- [ ] Test the hypothesis_tracking template
- [ ] Test the process_capture template
- [ ] Validate frontmatter compliance
- [ ] Check CI/CD integration

**Future Exploration**:
- How to integrate with LLM context optimization
- How to automate phase detection
- How to create cross-phase linking

## Open Questions
**Still Unclear**:
- Will this scale to larger projects?
- How will team collaboration work with phase-specific docs?
- What about hybrid phases?

**Needs More Investigation**:
- LLM integration patterns
- Automation opportunities
- Performance metrics

## Context for Future Recall
**Why This Exploration Matters**:
This addresses the core issue of premature summarization during creative exploration, which was identified as a major problem in our chronicle capsule analysis.

**Key Context**:
We're in sandboxing phase, testing a new approach to documentation that matches thinking modes to documentation practices.

**Fragile Insights**:
- The phase mismatch was causing us to lose nuanced process details
- Exploration-focused templates feel more natural for creative work
- The system maintains our philosophical approach while adding practical structure
