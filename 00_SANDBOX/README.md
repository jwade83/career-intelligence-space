# Sandbox: Interrelated Pre-Deployment Planning

## Purpose
Capture complex interrelated systems and their interdependencies before structured implementation. 
**Critical**: This is not linear planning - it's systems thinking with cascading implications.

## Core Principle
**Every decision affects multiple systems.** Sandboxing must capture:
- Direct relationships between components
- Cascading effects and dependencies
- Timing and sequencing constraints
- Technical corner avoidance strategies

## Structure
- `systems/` - Interrelated system mappings and dependencies
- `timing/` - Sequencing and deployment timing analysis
- `constraints/` - Technical limitations and corner avoidance
- `experiments/` - Proof-of-concepts that test interrelatedness
- `design_notes/` - Architecture that considers multiple systems

## Interrelatedness Framework
Every sandbox entry must consider:
1. **Direct Dependencies**: What does this connect to?
2. **Cascading Effects**: What breaks if this changes?
3. **Timing Constraints**: What must happen when?
4. **Technical Corners**: What paths does this close?
5. **Future Scaling**: How does this affect Stage B → C → D?

## Workflow
1. **Map Interrelatedness** - Don't just plan, map the system
2. **Test Dependencies** - Experiment with how changes cascade
3. **Validate Timing** - Ensure sequencing doesn't create deadlocks
4. **Check Corners** - Verify no technical paths are closed
5. **Structure** - When all interdependencies are understood, graduate
