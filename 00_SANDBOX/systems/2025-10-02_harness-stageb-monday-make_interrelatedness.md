# System Interrelatedness: Harness ↔ Stage B ↔ Monday.com ↔ Make.com

## System Overview
**What is this system?** The interrelated evolution from current Stage B (Quality Gatekeeper) to future Stage C (External Intelligence) through Monday.com + Make.com integration
**Why does it exist?** Solve immediate orientation problem while building foundation for Harness immune system
**What stage?** Stage B (current) with Stage C architecture (planned)

## Direct Dependencies

### Inputs (What feeds this system?)
- **Harness Architecture**: C1-C7 collapse prevention requirements
- **Stage B Constraints**: Manual quality gates, current tooling limitations
- **Orientation Need**: Scattered information across GitHub, external tools, conversations
- **Repository Structure**: Existing 08_CHRONICLE/ → structured progression

### Outputs (What does this system feed?)
- **Externalized Memory**: Monday.com as "always-on" memory bank
- **Enforcement Layer**: Make.com as "nothing lives only in chat" enforcer
- **Collapse Prevention**: Foundation for C1-C7 antibody deployment
- **Stage C Evolution**: Automated intelligence integration capability

## Cascading Effects

### If Monday.com Integration Changes:
- **Positive Cascades**: 
  - Better orientation → faster decision making
  - Externalized memory → reduced context switching
  - Structured data → easier automation
- **Negative Cascades**: 
  - Vendor lock-in → migration complexity
  - API limits → workflow bottlenecks
  - Cost scaling → budget constraints
- **Unintended Consequences**: 
  - Over-reliance on external system
  - Potential data silos

### If Make.com Integration Changes:
- **Positive Cascades**: 
  - Automated externalization → reduced manual work
  - Workflow orchestration → better system coherence
  - Integration flexibility → easier system evolution
- **Negative Cascades**: 
  - Complex automation → debugging difficulty
  - Rate limits → workflow failures
  - Single point of failure → system brittleness
- **Unintended Consequences**: 
  - Automation complexity → maintenance burden
  - Hidden dependencies → system fragility

### If Harness Requirements Change:
- **Positive Cascades**: 
  - Better collapse prevention → system reliability
  - Antifragility → system strength under stress
  - Provenance tracking → decision traceability
- **Negative Cascades**: 
  - Hardware requirements → implementation complexity
  - Enforcement overhead → workflow friction
  - System complexity → maintenance burden
- **Unintended Consequences**: 
  - Over-engineering → reduced agility
  - Complex dependencies → system brittleness

## Timing Constraints

### Must Happen Before:
- **Stage C Evolution** - Need externalized memory foundation
- **Harness Deployment** - Need enforcement layer infrastructure
- **Field Agent Scaling** - Need automated intake processing

### Must Happen After:
- **Repository Structure Stabilization** - Need stable data formats
- **Frontmatter Compliance** - Need consistent metadata
- **Basic Automation** - Need simple workflows working

### Critical Windows:
- **Deployment Window**: After PR #65 merge, before major new features
- **Testing Window**: During low-activity periods to avoid disruption
- **Rollback Window**: Before any critical project deadlines

## Technical Corner Analysis

### Paths This Opens:
- **Externalized Memory** - Enables Harness C1-C7 prevention
- **Automated Externalization** - Enables "nothing lives only in chat"
- **Integration Flexibility** - Enables future system evolution
- **Provenance Tracking** - Enables decision reconstruction

### Paths This Closes:
- **Pure Repository Workflow** - Reduces direct file-based operations
- **Manual Quality Gates** - Automates Stage B processes
- **Simple Tooling** - Introduces complex integration dependencies
- **Vendor Independence** - Creates Monday.com + Make.com dependencies

### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Portable Data Formats** - Use standard formats for easy migration
- **Abstraction Layers** - Build interfaces that can be swapped
- **Export Capabilities** - Ensure data can be extracted
- **Fallback Workflows** - Maintain manual processes as backup

## Future Scaling Impact

### Stage B → Stage C:
- **Enables**: 
  - Automated intelligence integration
  - Reduced manual quality gate overhead
  - Better system coherence and orientation
- **Constrains**: 
  - Requires external system dependencies
  - Introduces integration complexity
  - Creates vendor lock-in risk
- **Requires**: 
  - Monday.com workspace design
  - Make.com automation flows
  - GitHub integration mapping

### Stage C → Stage D:
- **Enables**: 
  - Full action-execution-intelligence ecosystem
  - Advanced collapse prevention
  - Antifragile system architecture
- **Constrains**: 
  - Requires sophisticated automation
  - Needs advanced monitoring
  - Demands high system reliability
- **Requires**: 
  - Advanced Make.com scenarios
  - Complex Monday.com workflows
  - Harness antibody deployment

## Integration Points

### Current Integration:
- **Repository** ↔ **Monday.com** - [Planned: GitHub issues → Monday cards]
- **Repository** ↔ **Make.com** - [Planned: Automated externalization]

### Planned Integration:
- **Monday.com** ↔ **Make.com** - [Automated workflow orchestration]
- **GitHub** ↔ **Monday.com** - [Bidirectional status sync]
- **Drive** ↔ **Monday.com** - [Document attachment sync]

### Future Integration:
- **Field Agent** ↔ **Monday.com** - [Mobile input processing]
- **Harness** ↔ **Make.com** - [Collapse prevention automation]
- **Stage C** ↔ **Monday.com** - [Intelligence integration]

## Decision Rationale
**Why this approach?** Solves immediate orientation need while building foundation for Harness architecture
**What alternatives were considered?** GitHub Projects, n8n self-hosted, pure repository workflow
**Why not the alternatives?** 
- GitHub Projects: Limited automation capabilities
- n8n self-hosted: Higher operational complexity
- Pure repository: Doesn't solve orientation problem
**What assumptions are we making?** 
- Monday.com + Make.com will remain stable
- Integration complexity is manageable
- Cost scaling is acceptable
