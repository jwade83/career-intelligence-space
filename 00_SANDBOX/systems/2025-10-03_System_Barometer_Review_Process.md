# System Barometer Review Process

## Process Definition

**System Barometer Review**: A meta-cognitive assessment process that periodically examines the repository's scope, purpose, and direction to identify scope drift, validate alignment, and capture key insights about the system's evolution.

**Core Purpose**: Ensure the Career Intelligence Space remains focused on its mission while evolving its capabilities and architecture.

## Process Components

### **1. Barometer Review Trigger**
**Manual Triggers:**
- After significant development sessions
- Before major architectural decisions
- When scope concerns arise
- At milestone completions

**Automatic Triggers:**
- Weekly scheduled reviews
- After 10+ commits in a week
- When new major systems are added
- Before phase transitions

### **2. Review Analysis Framework**
**Scope Validation:**
- Is the work aligned with career intelligence mission?
- Are we building career tools or meta-systems?
- What's the practical value for career development?

**Process Assessment:**
- How is the development process working?
- What patterns are emerging in our work?
- Are we maintaining the right balance of exploration vs. implementation?

**Capability Evolution:**
- What new capabilities are we developing?
- How do they serve the career intelligence mission?
- What's the competitive advantage we're building?

### **3. Insight Capture Structure**
**Key Insights Format:**
- **Scope Alignment**: How well does current work serve the mission?
- **Process Observations**: What patterns are emerging in our development?
- **Capability Assessment**: What new abilities are we developing?
- **Risk Identification**: What concerns or scope drift is occurring?
- **Recommendations**: What should we do differently or continue?

## Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Manual Process (Immediate)**
**File Structure:**
```
08_CHRONICLE/barometer/
├── 2025-10-03_System_Barometer_Review_v1.md
├── 2025-10-10_System_Barometer_Review_v2.md
└── templates/
    └── TEMPLATE_barometer_review.md
```

**Process:**
1. Create barometer review document
2. Conduct meta-cognitive analysis
3. Capture key insights and recommendations
4. Store in 08_CHRONICLE/barometer/
5. Prompt for user response and capture

### **Phase 2: Semi-Automated Process (Near-term)**
**Automation Components:**
- Template-based review prompts
- Automated file creation with timestamps
- Structured analysis framework
- Response capture system

**Tools:**
- GitHub Actions workflow for scheduled reviews
- Template system for consistent structure
- Automated prompting for user responses

### **Phase 3: Intelligent Process (Future)**
**AI-Enhanced Components:**
- Automated scope drift detection
- Pattern recognition in development work
- Intelligent insight generation
- Predictive scope validation
