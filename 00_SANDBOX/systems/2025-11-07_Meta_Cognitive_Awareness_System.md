# Meta-Cognitive Awareness System

## Overview

This system provides meta-cognitive awareness and self-monitoring capabilities for the Autopoietic Behavioral Symbiosis system. It enables the system to assess its own performance, detect drift, and implement course corrections to maintain alignment with design principles and human agency.

## Core Meta-Cognitive Capabilities

### **1. Performance Drift Detection**

#### **Tone Drift Detection**
**Indicators**:
- Shift from exploratory to promotional language
- Loss of critical questioning and analysis
- Overuse of affirmative and supportive responses
- Reduction in nuanced, complex reasoning

**Detection Mechanisms**:
- Language pattern analysis across conversations
- Response type classification (exploratory vs. convergent vs. promotional)
- Critical questioning frequency monitoring
- Nuance preservation assessment

**Corrective Actions**:
- Meta-intent blocks before AI sessions
- Rationale blocks before automation
- Reflexive notes after work sessions
- Weekly reflexive capsules for pattern analysis

#### **Premature Convergence Detection**
**Indicators**:
- Jumping to solutions without sufficient exploration
- Over-optimization of processes before understanding
- Loss of divergent thinking and exploration
- Reduction in meta-cognitive questioning

**Detection Mechanisms**:

- Solution generation timing assessment
- Exploration depth measurement
- Meta-cognitive trigger frequency

**Corrective Actions**:
- Phase-appropriate documentation workflows
- Meta-cognitive activation protocols

### **3. Meta-Cognitive Texture Loss Detection**

#### **Cognitive Depth Monitoring**
**Indicators**:

- Loss of philosophical depth

**Detection Mechanisms**:
- Reasoning complexity analysis
- Meta-cognitive question frequency
- Concept complexity preservation
- Philosophical depth assessment

**Corrective Actions**:
- Meta-cognitive trigger enhancement
- Complexity preservation protocols
- Philosophical depth maintenance
- Nuanced reasoning requirements

## Corrective Mechanisms

### **1. Micro-Habits Implementation**

#### **Meta-Intent Blocks**
```
Before starting any AI session:
- Context: [internal_diagnostic | system_mode | personal_experiment | phase: divergent]
- Meta-intent: [explore options for X, not finalize anything yet]
- Purpose: Reminds both human and AI which phase they're in
```

#### **Rationale Blocks**
```
Before using any automation or tool:
- What tool am I calling?
- Why does this step need automation right now?
- What am I checking after it runs?
- Purpose: Forces 10-second sanity check before automation
```

#### **Reflexive Notes**
```
At the end of every work session:
- Mode used: [divergent | convergent]?
- Any tone drift? [affirmative, promotional, etc.]
- Did automation run too early?
- What's the next human review step?
- Purpose: Restores metacognitive texture
```

### **2. Structured Review Processes**

#### **Weekly Reflexive Capsules**
- **Highlights**: Where drift occurred
- **Changes**: One change to test next week
- **Processes**: What felt heavy or redundant
- **Storage**: `/08_CHRONICLE/reflexive_capsules/`

#### **ChatGPT as Reflexive Auditor**
```
Prompt: "Act as Reflexive Auditor. Check tone, phase, and boundary integrity in the following text. Output only a short diagnostic summary."
- Purpose: Provides second human layer of reflection
- Usage: Run after major outputs
- Output: Short diagnostic summary
```

### **3. System-Level Corrections**

#### **Phase-Appropriate Documentation**
