# System Interrelatedness: [System Name]

## System Overview
**What is this system?** Brief description
**Why does it exist?** Core purpose and value
**What stage?** Current maturity level

## Direct Dependencies
### Inputs (What feeds this system?)
- **System A**: [How it connects]
- **System B**: [How it connects]
- **External**: [External dependencies]

### Outputs (What does this system feed?)
- **System C**: [How it connects]
- **System D**: [How it connects]
- **External**: [External outputs]

## Cascading Effects
### If This System Changes:
- **Positive Cascades**: [What improves downstream]
- **Negative Cascades**: [What breaks downstream]
- **Unintended Consequences**: [What we didn't expect]

### If This System Fails:
- **Immediate Impact**: [What stops working]
- **Secondary Impact**: [What becomes unreliable]
- **Recovery Path**: [How to restore function]

## Timing Constraints
### Must Happen Before:
- [System/Event] - [Why timing matters]
- [System/Event] - [Why timing matters]

### Must Happen After:
- [System/Event] - [Why sequencing matters]
- [System/Event] - [Why sequencing matters]

### Critical Windows:
- **Deployment Window**: [When this can be deployed]
- **Testing Window**: [When this can be tested]
- **Rollback Window**: [When rollback is possible]

## Technical Corner Analysis
### Paths This Opens:
- [Technical capability] - [How it enables future work]
- [Technical capability] - [How it enables future work]

### Paths This Closes:
- [Technical limitation] - [Why this constrains future options]

### Mitigation Strategies:
- [Strategy] - [How to preserve future options]
- [Strategy] - [How to preserve future options]

## Future Scaling Impact
### Stage B → Stage C:
- **Enables**: [What this makes possible]
- **Constrains**: [What this limits]
- **Requires**: [What additional work is needed]

### Stage C → Stage D:
- **Enables**: [What this makes possible]
- **Constrains**: [What this limits]
- **Requires**: [What additional work is needed]

## Integration Points
### Current Integration:
- [System] ↔ [This System] - [How they connect now]

### Planned Integration:
- [System] ↔ [This System] - [How they will connect]
- [System] ↔ [This System] - [How they will connect]

### Future Integration:
- [System] ↔ [This System] - [How they might connect]

## Decision Rationale
**Why this approach?** [Core reasoning]
**What alternatives were considered?** [Other options]
