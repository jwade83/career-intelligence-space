# Sandboxing System: ChatGPT Assessment Overview

## Purpose
This file provides ChatGPT with a comprehensive overview of our sandboxing system for systematic assessment and analysis.

## System Overview
The sandboxing system is designed to capture complex interrelated systems and their interdependencies before structured implementation. It's specifically optimized for LLM context and knowledge formation through praxis.

## Core Philosophy
**Every decision affects multiple systems.** Sandboxing must capture:
- Direct relationships between components
- Cascading effects and dependencies
- Timing and sequencing constraints
- Technical corner avoidance strategies

## Directory Structure

## Key Files to Review
1. **System Interrelatedness Analysis**: `systems/2025-10-02_harness-stageb-monday-make_interrelatedness.md`
2. **Prerequisite Templates**: `templates/prerequisites/`
3. **System Overview**: `README.md`

## Current Focus
We're working on the interrelatedness between:
- **Harness Architecture** (C1-C7 collapse prevention)
- **Stage B Evolution** (Quality gatekeeper progression)
- **Monday.com + Make.com Integration** (Orientation and workflow automation)

## Assessment Questions for ChatGPT
1. How effectively does this sandboxing structure capture interrelatedness?
2. What gaps exist in the current template system?
3. How well does this support LLM knowledge formation?
4. What improvements would enhance the system's effectiveness?
