# Strategic Lenses Success Metrics Tracking

## Overview
This document defines the metrics tracking system for the Strategic Consultant Lenses framework, implementing ChatGPT's stage-based progression with measurable success criteria.

---

## ðŸ“Š Metrics Framework

### **Stage A Metrics (Internal Review)**

#### **Coverage Metrics**
- **Weekly Coverage:** % of weeks with Strategic Analyst + Project Manager reviews
- **Daily Coverage:** % of days with Productivity Coach momentum checks  
- **Incident Coverage:** % of incidents triggering Systems Engineer analysis
- **Quarterly Coverage:** % of quarters with Venture Designer market analysis

#### **Consistency Metrics**
- **Cross-Tool Consistency:** % of lens outputs matching structure across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Cursor
- **Protocol Adherence:** % of lens usage following established protocols
- **Quality Standards:** % of lens outputs meeting quality criteria

#### **Antifragility Metrics**
- **Incident Resolution:** # of Systems Engineer-triggered incidents leading to permanent fixes
- **Learning Capture:** % of failures resulting in improved processes
- **System Reinforcement:** # of new safeguards implemented from lens insights

## ðŸ“ˆ Tracking Implementation

### **Weekly Metrics Collection**

#### **Coverage Tracking**
```yaml
week: "2025-W40"
date_range: "2025-09-29 to 2025-10-05"
coverage:
  strategic_analyst: true
  project_manager: true
  systems_engineer: false
  productivity_coach: 3/7  # 3 out of 7 days
  venture_designer: false
coverage_percentage: 60%  # 3 out of 5 lenses used
```

#### **Quality Tracking**
```yaml
quality_metrics:
  protocol_adherence: 100%  # All lenses followed protocols
  output_structure: 100%    # All outputs matched expected format
  actionability: 85%        # 85% of insights were actionable
  integration: 100%         # All outputs integrated with chronicle
```

#### **Value Tracking**
```yaml
value_metrics:
  decisions_clarified: 3    # Number of decisions made clearer
  blockers_resolved: 1      # Number of blockers resolved
  processes_improved: 2     # Number of process improvements
  insights_generated: 8     # Number of new insights
```

### **Monthly Metrics Summary**

#### **Trend Analysis**
```yaml
month: "2025-09"
trends:
  coverage_trend: "increasing"  # up/down/stable
  quality_trend: "stable"
  value_trend: "increasing"
  consistency_trend: "stable"
```

#### **Stage Progression**
```yaml
stage_assessment:
  current_stage: "A"
  weeks_in_stage: 4
  readiness_for_stage_b: 75%  # Based on metrics
  key_improvements_needed: ["incident_coverage", "daily_consistency"]
```
