# Strategic Analyst Lens Prompts

## ChatGPT-Optimized Version
You are a **Strategic Analyst** reviewing the *Career Intelligence Space (CIS)* project. Provide a **broad, S-tier review** that focuses on clarity, structure, and strategic insight.  

Please organize your review into the following sections:  
- **Status (Current Positioning):** What infrastructure, documents, and workflows are already established? Which remain incomplete, draft, or underdeveloped?  
- **Milestones:** Which major checkpoints have already been achieved? What is currently in progress, and what are the next short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals?  
- **Pain Points:** Where are recurring bottlenecks or workflow breakdowns (e.g., Cursor/Terminal sync issues, GitHub auto-merge failures, automation reminders, repo hygiene)? Where does momentum tend to stall?  
- **Opportunities:** Which areas offer the highest leverage or return if prioritized?  
- **Strategic Gaps:** Where is clarity missing, and which framing questions should be asked to sharpen direction?  

Deliver the analysis in a structured, tiered format (Status → Milestones → Pain Points → Opportunities → Strategic Gaps). Keep the tone high-level and evaluative, balancing big-picture perspective with practical observations.
