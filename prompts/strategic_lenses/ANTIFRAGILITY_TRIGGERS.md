# Antifragility Triggers - Strategic Lenses Incident Response

## Overview
This document defines how failures, workflow breaks, and incidents become opportunities to trigger strategic lenses, capture learning, and reinforce the CIS system through antifragility principles.

---

## üéØ Antifragility Principles

1. **Failures as Learning Opportunities** - Every incident is a chance to improve the system
2. **Automatic Lens Triggering** - Specific incidents automatically trigger relevant lenses
3. **Learning Capture** - All incidents result in documented insights and improvements
4. **System Reinforcement** - Incidents lead to permanent safeguards and process improvements
5. **Continuous Improvement** - Each incident makes the system more robust

## üîß Incident Response Workflow

### **Phase 1: Immediate Response (0-2 hours)**
1. **Document Incident** - Create incident record in `/08_CHRONICLE/incidents/`
2. **Assess Impact** - Determine scope and severity
3. **Trigger Lenses** - Activate appropriate lens combination
4. **Begin Analysis** - Start lens-based analysis

### **Phase 2: Analysis & Resolution (2-24 hours)**
1. **Complete Lens Analysis** - Run triggered lenses for comprehensive analysis
2. **Identify Root Causes** - Use lens insights to find underlying issues
3. **Implement Fixes** - Apply technical and process improvements
4. **Document Solutions** - Record all changes and improvements

### **Phase 3: Learning & Reinforcement (1-7 days)**
1. **Capture Learning** - Document insights and lessons learned
2. **Update Protocols** - Improve processes based on incident
3. **Implement Safeguards** - Add prevention measures
4. **Share Knowledge** - Update team and documentation

### **Phase 4: Follow-up & Validation (1-4 weeks)**
1. **Monitor Effectiveness** - Track if fixes prevent recurrence
2. **Validate Improvements** - Ensure safeguards are working
3. **Refine Protocols** - Adjust based on real-world performance
4. **Celebrate Success** - Acknowledge system improvement
