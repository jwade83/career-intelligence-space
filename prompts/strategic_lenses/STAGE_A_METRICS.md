## Tracking Process

### **Daily Collection**
1. **Productivity Coach Usage** - Track daily momentum checks
2. **Incident Triggers** - Log any Systems Engineer lens triggers
3. **Quality Assessment** - Quick quality check of any lens outputs

### **Weekly Collection**
1. **Coverage Assessment** - Which lenses were used this week
2. **Quality Review** - Assess output quality and protocol adherence
3. **Value Assessment** - Track decisions, blockers, and improvements
4. **Trend Analysis** - Compare to previous weeks

### **Stage Assessment**
1. **Week 3:** Mid-stage review and optimization
2. **Week 6:** Final Stage A assessment and Stage B readiness

---

## Success Indicators

### **Stage A Success**
- **Consistent Usage:** Regular lens application across all types
- **Quality Maintenance:** High standards maintained throughout
- **Metrics Collection:** Reliable data gathering established
- **Process Refinement:** Protocols improved based on experience

### **Stage B Readiness**
- **Coverage:** ≥90% weekly coverage for all applicable lenses
- **Consistency:** ≥95% protocol adherence
- **Quality:** ≥90% of outputs meeting quality standards
- **Antifragility:** Evidence of learning from incidents
- **Duration:** 6 weeks of stable Stage A performance
