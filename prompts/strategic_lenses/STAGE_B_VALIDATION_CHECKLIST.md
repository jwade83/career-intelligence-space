# Stage B Validation Checklist

## Stage B Launch Readiness Assessment

### **GitHub Action Testing** ✅
- [x] **Frontmatter Validation GitHub Action Created** - `.github/workflows/frontmatter-validation.yml`
- [x] **Local Pre-commit Hook Tested** - Blocks invalid files, allows valid files
- [x] **GitHub Action Logic Validated** - Same validation logic as pre-commit hook
- [x] **Error Messages Tested** - Clear, actionable guidance provided
- [x] **No False Positives** - Doesn't block legitimate commits
- [x] **Repo-wide Enforcement Ready** - Works across all environments and collaborators

### **Promotion Gate Rules** ✅
- [x] **Status Progression Defined** - `draft → in-review → matured → promoted`
- [x] **Lens Review Requirements** - Each status change requires relevant lens analysis
- [x] **Quality Standards Established** - 100% protocol adherence maintained
- [x] **Promotion Criteria Documented** - Clear requirements for each status level
- [x] **Automated Validation Planned** - GitHub Actions for promotion gates

### **Lens Cadence Documentation** ✅
- [x] **Weekly Reviews** - Strategic Analyst + Project Manager + Productivity Coach
- [x] **Incident Response** - Systems Engineer triggered by failures/incidents
- [x] **Quarterly Reviews** - Venture Designer for market analysis and strategic positioning
- [x] **Daily Check-ins** - Productivity Coach for momentum and energy management
- [x] **On-demand Analysis** - Any lens triggered by specific needs or questions

### **Metrics Dashboard Structure** ✅
- [x] **Coverage Metrics** - % of weeks with lens reviews logged
- [x] **Quality Metrics** - Protocol adherence, output structure, actionability
- [x] **Value Metrics** - Decisions clarified, blockers resolved, processes improved
- [x] **Antifragility Metrics** - Incidents identified, safeguards implemented, MTTR
- [x] **Stage Progress Tracking** - Coverage progression, milestone completion
- [x] **Markdown-based Dashboard** - `STAGE_A_METRICS.md` structure established
