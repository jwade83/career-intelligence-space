# Stage B Metrics Tracking - Quality Gatekeeper

## Stage B Overview
**Duration:** 4-6 cycles (4-6 weeks)  
**Goal:** Lenses become part of the promotion path for artifacts  
**Success Criteria:** % of artifacts reviewed with lenses; % of incidents resulting in new safeguards

---

## Stage B Success Criteria

### **Primary Metrics**
- **Promotion Rate:** % of artifacts successfully promoted through lens-gated workflows
- **Incident Resolution:** MTTR for incidents triggered by automated lens checks
- **Compliance:** % of new/updated artifacts adhering to frontmatter, naming, and tagging standards
- **Lens Adoption:** % of critical workflows where lenses are automatically or manually applied
- **System Stability:** Uptime and reliability of GitHub Actions and integrated automations

### **Target Thresholds**
- **Promotion Rate:** â‰¥85% of artifacts pass lens review
- **Incident Resolution:** â‰¤2 hours MTTR for automated incidents
- **Compliance:** â‰¥95% of artifacts meet standards
- **Lens Adoption:** â‰¥80% of critical workflows use lenses
- **System Stability:** â‰¥99% uptime for GitHub Actions
