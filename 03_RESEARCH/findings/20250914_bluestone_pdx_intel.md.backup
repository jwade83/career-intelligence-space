## 6-24 Month Wage/Certification Trajectory

### 6-Month Outlook
- **Base wage adjustment:** Minimal expected given no-overtime structure
- **Certification opportunities:** Limited by company policy to prevent advancement
- **Skill development:** Basic maintenance competencies only
- **Market positioning:** Likely to remain below median

### 12-Month Trajectory  
- **Wage growth:** $0.50-1.00/hour typical for BMT annual increases
- **Certification barriers:** Company-imposed limitations on advanced training
- **Alternative pathways:** External certification pursuit required for meaningful advancement
- **Total compensation:** Remains constrained by overtime prohibition

### 24-Month Analysis
- **Career ceiling:** Limited internal advancement due to company structure
- **Market competitiveness:** Falling further behind market rates without overtime premium
- **Exit strategy required:** External opportunities needed for career progression
- **Certification value:** Outside training essential for maintaining market relevance

### Trajectory Narrative
Bluestone's compensation structure creates a career development bottleneck. The no-overtime policy eliminates a significant income stream typical in BMT roles (20-30% earnings boost), while training restrictions prevent natural skill advancement. Within 24 months, a technician would likely face stagnation requiring external certification pursuit or job change to maintain market competitiveness. The company's business model appears designed to maintain low-cost labor rather than develop skilled professionals.
